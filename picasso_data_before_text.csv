NOTE: Standing over twenty inches tall and with a commanding physical presence, the ""Vase deux anses grand oiseau"" has an elegance and power singularly stated within the oeuvre of Picasso's unique ceramic works. By using darker hues and alternating the contours of the form separated by a white glaze, this large bird as a two-handled vase gains recognizable definition and movement from one compositional element to the next. Somewhat bizarrely, a smiling anthropomorphic head with incised features rests on the center of the breast, as the wings become grotesque ears and the handles ringed horns. The alternating use of color and line guides the eye from the simple-footed base to the incised features of the bird's head at top, always drawing us back into the plentiful middle, where we alternate between seeing both man and beast.

NOTE: Accompanied by a Certificate of Authenticity from the Picasso Foundation. Painted by the artist in 1918 for his dear friend, Madame Eugenia Errazuriz, this exceedingly rare fresco originally decorated a wall in her Southern France villa, La Mimoseraie. Eugenia was a patron of Modernism and was a hugely influential figure for many of the great artists of the time, including Picasso, who considered her to be his mentor, muse, and model. It was at La Mimoseraie that Picasso and his first wife, Olga Khokhlova, spent their honeymoon as guests of Eugenia. As a thank you to his hostess, Picasso shut himself away upstairs in the ""Blue Room"" and painted a series of murals depicting bathers, florals, and verses written by his dear friend, the French poet, Guillaume Apollinaire. Illustrated in this work alongside a pretty vase of flowers is the first quatrain from the poem, ""Les Saisons"", which reads: ""It was a blessed time, we passed it on the beaches Go there at first light, hatless and barefoot Quick as the flitting tongue of a toad Love's Cupid wounded to the heart both fool and sage alike"". For Picasso, this quatrain epitomized the mood of his classical honeymoon, with its allusion to Cupid's arrow and the surrounding organic imagery. The painting's large scale and energetic execution reflect a period of intense love and excitement for the artist. It celebrates Picasso's new marriage to Olga but also expresses his love of the Mediterranean, which inspired him to paint the mythological themes that became such important and enduring motifs in his art.

The work from 1931 — a scene depicting a classical bust, wine bottle, fruit, and a window surrounded by a flourish of ironwork is signed Picasso in the upper right. The back bears a faded label from its last exhibition: “‘Bonne Fête’ Monsieur Picasso,” at the UCLA Art Galleries, 1961, on the occasion of the modern master’s 80th birthday. It appears in the exhibition catalog which featured loans from Hollywood notables Kirk Douglas, Vincent Price, and Mrs. Gary Cooper, as well as the Los Angeles Museum of Art, as number 95. The painting, a tempera (gouache) on paper, measures 19 5/8 x 25 ¾ "", and its original owner was Alfred Hitchcock, who lent it to the UCLA exhibition. It came to Houston via the late director’s only child, daughter Pat Hitchcock O’Connell, who gifted it to her best friend, Georgia Waller, and her husband, Gerard Waller. It was bestowed upon them in 1982, after Hitchcock and his wife Alma had both passed on. Mrs. Waller died in 2008, and Mr. Waller is now sending the painting with the Hollywood provenance to auction. (Hitchcock worked with Picasso and Dali and is known for employing artwork throughout his films to great effect; he also commissioned Dalí to create a dream sequence for his 1945 film Spellbound.)

Property from a Private Collector, New York    LITERATURE Georges Bloch 695; Brigitte Baer 891   Pablo had told me, that first afternoon I visited him alone, in February 1944, that he felt our relationship would bring light into both of our lives. My coming to him, he said, seemed like a window that was opening up and he wanted it to remain open. I did, too, as long as it let in the light. During the fall of 1952 [Madame Ramié] imported a young cousin of hers named Jacqueline Roque to be a salesgirl at the pottery [shop]…She spoke a little Spanish and since very little pottery was sold in the winter, her chief occupation appeared to be holding conversations in Spanish with Pablo…he undoubtedly saw Jacqueline Roque and talked with her more often than I might have imagined at the time, had I given it any thought…A week after I left Vallauris on September 30, Pablo came to Paris and stayed two weeks. Within a week of the time he got back to the Midi, Jacqueline Roque had taken over.

"Pablo Picasso (Spanish; 1881-1973) ""Picador and Bull"" Original Copper Plate & Artist Proof Etching From the Carmen Suite (1 of 4 Aquatints for the Deluxe Edition) W/COAs - This magnificent specimen is an original copper plate and etching by one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, Pablo Picasso. This plate and etching are a part of the Carmen Suite, created by Picasso while in Paris and remembering his homeland. The collection was inspired by one of the most poignant works in Spanish literature, ""Carmen"" by Prosper Merimee, and consisted of 42 copper plates and 38 etchings, made for an illustrated version of the book, in an extremely limited edition of only 320. The plates were made by Picasso and the etchings were printed either by Picasso, or by Roger Lacourier in Paris. This piece is titled ""Picador and Bull"" and was created by Picasso in 1949.  The piece is especially significant as it is a copper plate made by Picasso for one of only four aquatints for the deluxe editions of the illustrated book ""Carmen"". Of the 320 illustrated versions of ""Carmen"", only 11 were these deluxe editions. The original etching was also created by Picasso, and was the second of four artist working proofs that were printed by the artist on wove paper, using the sugar-lift aquatint method. This is a stunning piece that truly belongs in a museum, from one of Picasso's greatest collections. This is a once in a lifetime chance to own an original work by arguably one of the most influential and well known artists of all time. You will never see a piece like this again, as most people would likely never see anything more than pictures of this master's work in art books. The piece is dated in the lower right ""2.5.49 II"", and both will come with individual certificates of authenticity. The plate measures approx. 14"" x 11"", and the etching measures approx. 13 1/2"" x 10 7/8"".

The four states of the second variation are annotated on the reverse in pencil.

Fernand Mourlot, Paris, 1955 Heiner Hachmeister, Münster, 1984 Hans-Joachim Weber, Paderborn, 2003  Fernand Mourlot 265-266; not in Georges Bloch; Felix Reusse 659-663; Bernd Rau 606-610  The complete set of Femmes d’Alger have only appeared at auction together once before at the Sotheby’s Fernand Mourlot collection, November 14, 1994. These images were amazingly made by transferring a negative impression of an etching to zinc, then a needle and scraper were used to develop each progressive state. The extensive work to each state probably made the plate difficult to print from and resulted in abandoning an edition. The beautiful embossing from the deep scraping is quite apparent and gives the surface a texture not found in many lithographs. These experimental lithographs were done in January-March, 1955, in between the various fifteen paintings Picasso did of the same subject between December and April. This series of paintings and lithographs with The Women of Algiers as its theme was inspired by the paintings of Delacroix and conceived as a tribute to the recently deceased Matisse, Picasso’s artistic colleague. When questioned about this series, Picasso remarked to Roland Penrose, “When Matisse died he left his odalisques to me as a legacy and this is my idea of the Orient though I have never been there.” During a morning we spent with Les femmes d’Alger [painting(s)], Picasso showed us a schoolboy’s exercise-book that had belonged to Delacroix. He kept it lying open in the little engraving-room where the press was… Picasso handled the exercise-book with love. He showed us the writing, and in particular the little drawings in the margins of Delacroix’s schoolboy exercises. Hélène Parmelin, Picasso Plain, New York, 1963, p. 78 …Picasso’s intent oscillates between the professional and the erotic. Conventional sex symbols, forthright as a schoolboy’s graffiti, become the material of sophisticated corrdination. The artists moves from the evocation of female forms blown by desire, to the overall order within which all forms, anatomic and otherwise, serve to articulate surface tension; from the projections of women heaped and proffered like fruit, to stretching the field clear and taut for the charting of information.

Von 1930 bis 1937 schuf Picasso die Folge von hundert Grafiken, die nach dem Verleger und Kunsthändler Ambroise Vollard benannt wurde, der sie bei dem Künstler in Auftrag gab. Picasso variiert in der grafischen Suite unterschiedliche Themen wie Künstler und Modell oder den Minotaurus-Mythos. Das eindrucksvolle Hauptblatt der Suite wurde von Picasso am 12. Juni 1936 fertiggestellt und ist sowohl kompositorisch als auch technisch ein Meisterwerk. Es besticht durch seine kontrastreichen und dennoch äußerst harmonischen Nuancen. Die helle Binnenzeichnung in der Aquatinta vor der dunklen Wand des Hintergrundes erzeugt einen reizvollen, warmen Lichteffekt. Das Motiv basiert auf der Verführung Antiopes durch den Gottvater Zeus aus der griechischen Mytologie, später in der römischen Mythologie durch Jupiter ersetzt. Antiope, die Tochter des Königs Nykteus von Theben wurde, diesem Mythos folgend, von Zeus in Gestalt eines Satyrn im Schlaf überrascht und verführt.   Das graphische Werk Pablo Picassos lässt deutlich eine Folge von Schaffensperioden erkennen, bei denen jeweils eine bestimmte Technik im Vordergrund steht. Die Radierungen der ""Suite Vollard"" zeigen den Künstler auf dem Zenit seiner Schaffenskraft in diesem Medium.  Brillanter, differenzierter Druck mit Rand. In tadellos schöner Erhaltung.

It was printed in by Lacourière in a limited edition of 260 impressions in 1934 and published by A. Vollard, Paris.   This etching is from Picasso's most important series of etchings known as the Suite Vollard.  The Suite Vollard, created between 1930-37, was named after it publisher, the French art dealer and critic Ambroise Vollard. Picasso and Vollard shared a close working relationship up until 1910; however, after this date Vollard was no longer Picasso's dealer though the two continued to collaborate on publishing projects. In 1930, Vollard, encouraged by the success of two earlier ventures, ambitiously commissioned 100 plates from Picasso and by 1937 the plates were completed and given to master printer Roger Lacouriere to print. The entire edition comprises 3 copies on parchment, 50 copies on larger format Montval paper (50 x 38 cm) and 250 on smaller format Montval paper 44.5 x 34.0). Tragically, Ambroise Vollard died in a car crash 22 July 1939 leaving the project temporarily suspended, until a greater part of the edition was purchased by the print dealer Henri Petiet. After World War II Petiet engaged Picasso to sign a certain number of sets, and this continued up until 1969 but ceased with the publication of the 347 Series. Hence, a large number of the prints from the edition of 250 remain unsigned.   Provenance: Galleri Samlaren, Agnes Widlund, Stockholm  Acquired at the above in the 1950's or 1960's.

"Colored pencil drawing on wove paper with cut watermark ‘st Paper made in Docelles (...)’  Paris/France, 1963   Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) - Spanish painter, graphic artist and sculptor   Signed lower right in pencil, ‘Picasso’  Sheet dimensions: 21 x 27 cm   Matted and mounted in a silvered wooden frame  With a photo-expertise by Claude Ruiz-Picasso, Picasso Authentification, Paris, 30/06/2014  Provenance: Private collection, Brandenburg (gift of the artist to the GDR track athlete Günter Havenstein on the occasion of the Cross de l'Humanité in Paris in 1963, since then family-owned)  Picasso has frequently visited the subject of the dove of peace in his oeuvre; works on paper with dove have sold for more than €500,000 on the international auction market   A symbol for peace, the subject of the dove has been frequently visited by Picasso in his oeuvre. With its expressive contour lines, the dove is characterized by a distinctive design. The present drawing is particularly striking through the use of a multi-colored pen in rapid strokes. In 1949, Picasso designed and lithographed his first dove for the Paris World Peace Congress. In 1955, the work was awarded with the World Peace Prize. Since then, the dove is considered a worldwide symbol for peace, inspiring numerous artists, graphic artists and songwriters. The present drawing by Picasso fit thematically with the traditional running of the Cross de l'Humanité, which was held in Paris in 1963. On this occasion, the artist presented the drawing as a gift to the GDR track athlete Günter Havenstein. Since then it is family-owned.  The drawing is in good overall condition with beautiful bold colors. The paper is discolored in the mat cut-out due to age. The right part of the paper shows a bright spot. The lower area shows minor crease marks. The paper has been reinforced to the edges on the reverse. The sheet dimensions are 21 x 27 cm. The overall size, including the frame, is 36 x 40,5 cm. The drawing comes with a photo-expertise by Claude Ruiz-Picasso, Picasso Authentication Paris, dated from 30.06.2014.  Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)The Spanish painter, graphic artist and sculptor Pablo Picasso created a body of work of about 50,000 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and ceramics. He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. In 1901, Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from his Blue and Rose period, and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque were the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental painting Guernica (1937), no other work has marked the art of the 20th century in the same way. Two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes, were opened in his honor during his lifetime. Famous for the diversity of its expressions, Pablo Picasso is one of the most outstanding artists of the 20th century.    Shipping costs excl. statutory VAT and plus 2,5% (+VAT) shipping insurance.

"PABLO PICASSO (SPANISH, 1881-1973)  Minotaure Caressant une Dormeuse, 1933  drypoint etching  from the Vollard edition of 310  signed lower right: Picasso  watermarked to left margin: Vollard  29.5 x 36 cm  PROVENANCE:  Galerie Michael, Beverly Hills (bears certificate of authenticity verso)Private collection, Melbourne  LITTERATURE:George Bloch, Pablo Picasso: Catalogue de l’oeuvre grave et lithographie, Editions Kornfeld, Bern, 1968, 71, no. 201 (another example)Brigette Baer and Bernhard Geiser, Picasso, peintre-graveur, 2 volumes, Éditions Kornfeld, 1990 (vol. 1) and 1992 (vol. 2), no. 369.     ESSAY:  The Vollard Suite of etchings, aquatints and drypoints, created between 1930 and 1937 – a key period in the development of Pablo Picasso’s art – can be placed, without exaggeration, among the most significant and resolved bodies of graphic works in the history of Western art.  Through content, form and allegory, Picasso at once nods to his artistic progenitors whilst asserting himself as a Modernist. The ensemble of black and white images is an essay in the continuity of the medium’s tradition. It pays homage to the print-making heritage of Rembrandt, (to the point of directly representing the Dutchman himself in a number of plates), as well as acknowledging his compatriota, Goya, whose influential Taurmaquias are echoed in the climatic funereal sequence of the bullfighting scenes which close the Suite. The group of images confirms that Picasso, more than any of his contemporaries, was a product of his time, looking to reinvent and redevelop his visual vocabulary. The lucidity in his crisp and crinkled lines is the work of a mature artist and his distinctive qualities cannot be imagined without the cubist distortions he himself introduced two decades earlier. However, as Robert Hughes has noted, it was not just formal mastery that distinguished his singular work. In the eyes of the late critic, Picasso’s place in twentieth century consciousness was aided by his ‘unrivalled capacity for generating metaphors and images of metamorphoses.’[1]Nowhere are these two features of the essential Picasso, employed more emphatically than in the Vollard Suite.  The collection of one hundred images was commissioned by, and later named after, Ambroise Vollard – the Parisian art dealer who, back in 1901, had given el español his first exhibition in France. The majority of the intaglios were executed in the early 1930s following Picasso’s purchase of a new château-studio in Boisgelup, a small village sixty-three kilometres outside of Paris. In the tranquillity of this hamlet, Picasso would spend long days with his young muse, lover, and later mother of his first child, Marie-Thérèse Walter. And it is they, Marie and Pablo, who are the protagonists of the passions and struggles in the Vollard Suite. Their identities, however, are woven in the oeuvre’s two major themes stemming from Picasso’s interest in Classical literature: the Minotaur (the half-man half-bull creature) and Pygmalion (the artist who fell in love with his model), both characters taken from Ovid’s Metamorphoses.  In developing the series, Picasso introduced the Minotaur in May 1933 as a replacement for Pygmalion the sculptor – the artist’s original alter-ego. This new personage, the mythical man-beast, served as a fitting symbol of the artist’s own legendary artistic vitality and sexual energy. Marie-Thérèse continues to feature throughout the suite as an object of Picasso’s desires: though she goes from being a sensual ivory goddess, adored by the sculptor who brought her into existence and morphs into the sexually charged lover of the hairy, yet dignified, man-bull. In Minotaure Caressant une Dormeuse, the beautiful, nude Marie is at her most vulnerable. In deep, satisfying sleep, she is hardly perturbed by the dominant presence of the towering Minotaur who is, by contrast, fixed on her; this indifference only accentuates the hybrid beast’s gentleness and tender caress of the woman’s hand.  Going beyond the imagery, Picasso the peintre-graveur, demonstrates his technical proficiency in the handling of the intaglio. Departing from the clean and graceful lines that distinguished the images of Pygmalion and his muse, the present work, is made up of various techniques of mark-making: from the nervous, yet crisp outline of the male and female figures, to the curly and wiry squiggles of hair covering the Minotaur’s head and chest; from the light and soft linear shading between the two lovers, to the compact crosshatched blanket in the darkened background. In moving effortlessly between various styles and techniques – a Picassoan trait par excellence – we are reminded of the genius of the Spanish master.  Although Picasso continued to produce graphic prints till the very end of his career, he would never quite recapture the intensity or creative genius that characterises this impassioned series. A key image in Picasso’s oeuvre, Minotaure Caressant une Dormeuse remains one of the most prized and collected of all graphic works by that quasi-mythical figure in twentieth century art.

Picasso's almost 200 linocuts are whimsical, energized, and gestural, covering a variety of themes, such as bullfights, still lifes, the artist and his model, dancers and musicians, nudes, lovers, portraits, and interpretations of Old Master paintings.  Beginning in 1951, he also employed linocut for a series of posters for the annual pottery exhibition in Vallauris.  Apart from these posters, the linocuts were published by Galerie Louise Leiris in Paris, under the supervision of Picasso's longtime dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler. In 1963, toward the end of his career, Picasso invented a new technique for his linocuts, the rinsing method, in order to create a handmade appearance: He first prints the linoleum block [on white paper] in a cream white ink that repels water.  He then rinses the print in a water based India ink, which is absorbed by the non-printed areas of the sheet.  He then washes the ink from the sheet, thus removing it from the areas that had been printed in the cream white ink (A. Hyman, The Complete Linoleum Cuts, 1939-1968 in Picasso's Paintings, Watercolors, Drawings and Sculpture: A Comprehensive Illustrated Catalogue 1885-1973, San Francisco, 2012, preface). Exemplifying the rinsed linocut, the 1964 Journal au profil, also known as Collage with Stick Figures, is unique for several reasons.  As a depiction of a page of advertisements from the Nice newspaper Patriote, it is Picasso's only linocut that plays with the theme of a journal.  As such, it references his early synthetic Cubist collages coupling newspaper print with everyday objects. In addition, Journal au profil features mixed media and is therefore a variation of the traditional linocut.  For the base print, Picasso used a letterpress engraving with inset linocut images of bulls and figures that he had made the previous year, Profil, corrida, faune, et centaure poursuivant une baigneuse.  For the final product, he painted the bowl and pipe on top of this newspaper engraving, rinsed the sheet with India ink, and selectively washed off the ink to reveal underlying passages of white.  The resulting effect is layered and complex, simultaneously evoking painting, printmaking and collage.Alternate Artist Spellings: ""Pablo Picasso"", ""Picasso, Pablo"", ""Picasso, Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Crispín Crispiniano de la Santissima Trinidad Ruiz Blasco"", ""Picasso, Pablo Ruiz"", ""Picasso, Pablo Ruiz y"", ""Ruiz Picasso, Pablo"", ""Ruiz y Picasso, Pablo"", ""Ruiz, Pablo"", ""Ruys Picasso, Pablo"", ""Ruys, Pablo""

Presumably Picasso executed this sketch of a bouquet with three flowers in loose yet characteristically confident manner, in response to this note from Jacqueline. The flowers sketched refer to the legend of St. Dorothy: On her way to execution, due to her refusal of renouncing Christian faith, the young girl was mockingly requested by a doubting lawyer, Theophilus, to send him fruit from the heaven. St. Dorothy received a basket of three apples and three roses from an angel when she kneeled for prayer, which she gifted to the unbelieving lawyer. The young lawyer then converted to Christianity.  St. Dorothy is known as the patron saint of florists and brides, and February 6th is St. Dorothy's day that Jacqueline wrote the note and Picasso responded by this sketch.

"Partially glazed and engraved ceramic pitcher  France, 1953  Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) – Spanish Cubist painter and printmaker  Stamped and marked ‘Madoura Plein Feu / Edition Picasso / EDITION PICASSO’ on the underside  From the edition of 500  Ramié 193  Dimensions (height): 15 in. (37.5 cm.)  Very good condition  Estimate $55,000   A charismatic rendering of a woman, this ceramic uses green and white highlights to accentuate her facial features. Signified as a bearded man’s wife (see Ramié 217), the painted details highlight the organic shape of the pitcher. Designed by Picasso at Madoura Pottery Studio in the South of France, the work takes on an anthropomorphic quality. Another example recently fetched 104,500 GBP ($164,334) at Christie’s South Kensington in 2015.      Pablo Picasso (Spanish, 1881-1973)  A prolific and tireless innovator of art forms, Pablo Picasso impacted the course of 20th-century art with unparalleled magnitude. Inspired by Primitivism and developments in the world around him, Picasso contributed significantly to a number of artistic movements, notably Cubism, Surrealism, Neoclassicism, and Expressionism. Along with Georges Braque, Picasso is best known for pioneering Cubism in an attempt to reconcile three-dimensional space with the two-dimensional picture plane. Picasso’s sizable oeuvre includes over 50,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs.     Condition  In excellent condition.

"Cubist Drawing with Newspaper and Blue Marbled Paper Collage. Charcoal, white chalk (and possibly black chalk) on yellowed wove paper, 46.5 x 57 cm. Signed lower left “Picasso.” Inscriptions on the reverse: upper left in graphite “Cahier III page 15,” and below a mauvre collector ink stamp: Darius Tale Yar Khan 10 Berkeley Sqaure London: W1 (Known constructivist collector and consignor - Auction records include pieces sold at Fischer Auktionen, Shapiro and more), Bottom center in brown ink, fine-tipped pen: “Pierre Arland Avignon.” There is no trace of graphite underdrawing. The artist first lightly sketched-in much of the composition using a finely-pointed drawing tool, such a sharpened stick of black chalk or conté. This may include a few slight pentimenti, such as the outline of the lower edge of the newspaper upper right; horizontal and vertical underdrawn lines lower right were not reinforced with charcoal; the circle in the lower center may have been rubbed-out with a stump and moved to the upper right. Traces of charcoal are on the edges of the newsprint indicating that the charcoal lines were added after the newsprint was applied. It is possible that the artist may have used a ruler to lightly underdraw some of the geometric lines in very feint lines using sharpened black chalk. The paper has very fine brown spots on the surface which may be remnants of a fixative blown over the surface. Ca. seven fine pin marks along the top edge suggest the artist may have pinned the sheet to a board. Remnants of a .5cm paper hinge along the top reverse. 4.5cm tap repair upper right, 3cm tape repair lower right; discoloration and 1.5 cm tear upper left; 5 mm tear bottom center edge; paper loss due to former mount removal in four corners. The newspaper collage dates post-1911, as the offices of Le Petite Journal moved to the address listed in the colage as 61 rue Lafayette in 1911 (Patrick Eveno, Histoire de la Presse Francaise, Université de Paris, 2014). The word “Marc” in the drawing probably refers to a brand of French champagne, Vieux Marc de Champagne. Reference to Marc appears in Picasso’s 1911 etching Still Life with Bottle of Marc (Moma, printed 1912), Pipe, Glass, Bottle of Vieux Marc (Picasso Museum, 1914), and Juna Gris’ Guitar, Glass and Bottle of Vieux Marc.

"After Pablo Picasso  (Spanish/French, 1881-1973)   ""Le Repas des Enfants""   gemmail stained glass panel  signed in glass lower right.  Framed.   40"" x 53-1/2"", framed 48"" x 61-1/2""   Provenance: Private collection, Nice, France; Private collection, New York, New York.   Notes: The stunning glass art of gemmail is very rare, and by proxy, it is overlooked. The genre that flourished in the mid-20th century largely due to Pablo Picasso's avid endorsement of the medium that attracted the attention of notable celebrities with the means to purchase them, such as the Emperor of Japan, Prince Rainier of Monaco, Nelson Rockefeller, the Rothschilds and the Weisweillers.""Le Repas des Enfants (The Children's Meal)"" is the third known gemmail work to be offered at auction. These works are so unique that this lot was first thought to be a pate-de-verre when it was evaluated in 2010 at Sotheby's, New York; and the Evansville Museum in Evansville, Indiana, did not realize they owned a gemmail by Picasso for sixty-one years until a New York auction house traced the provenance of ""Femme Assise au Chapeau Rouge (Woman Seated with a Red Hat)"" to the industrial designer Raymond Lowery, who donated the work to the museum in 1961.     Gemmail, a compound word meaning ""enameled gem"" (gemme + email), known also in the plural as gemmaux, is a mid-20th century technique for creating 3D glass art that is designed to be viewed in front of a light box or illuminated from behind. French painter Jean Crotti invented the technique in the 1930s and perfected the process over the next twenty years through the assistance of his neighbor and business associates- the Malherbe-Navarre family (father and two sons), who were physicists that specialized in the molecular diffusion of light and fluorescence. In the early 1950s, they patented the idea and opened a production studio, ""Les Gemmaux de France."" Whereas stained glass proper uses lead  came  to join the pieces of glass, creating metal divisions (tracery)between them, gemmail is a more holistic process whereby multiple fragments of glass in varying sizes, shapes and colors are layered on a large piece of clear glass and then immersed in a special enamel solution to set the composition. The work is then placed in a low fire kiln that allows the pieces to bond, but not melt, creating a translucent painting that retains the clarity and superposition of the fragments.   Pablo Piccasso was immediately enamored by gemmail when fellow artist Jean Cocteau introduced him to it in 1954, and began experimenting with the process and collaboratively working with Crotti and the Malherbe-Navarres. Between 1954 and the first Picasso retrospective exhibition in 1957, Picasso authorized Les Gemmaux to reproduce sixty of his masterpieces, twenty of which were exhibited two years later in the first American exhibition of gemmaux.   When ""Le Repas des Enfants"" was evaluated in 2010 by Picasso's son, Claude, he stated that while the work was indeed a gemmail piece after his father's 1953 painting, he could not ascertain if the work was authorized by his father through Les Gemmaux as the records are incomplete. Gemmail pieces are typically signed before they are fired, so if ""Le Repas des Enfants"" was not produced by the Malherbe-Navarres on behalf of Picasso, then by whom? Of the sixty known works Les Gemmaux produced for Picasso, only the location of a handful are known, most remain in private collections. Is this stunning work of gemmail another discovery?","After Pablo Picasso, (Spanish/French, 1881-1973), ""Le",Sun,30000,30000,50000,26000,120,United States,6,569

Impressed by the quality of the resulting works, the artist decided to produce more ceramics in collaboration with Madoura. Inspired by ancient terracotta ‘tanagra’ figurines, Picasso had the idea to create a series of standing, kneeling and seated female figures in 1947. Picasso experimented with ceramic and perfected his pottery skills for over 20 years. Today Picasso’s Madoura ceramics are highly sought after by collectors.Condition:The object is in very good condition showing only slight signs of age and wear. Its height measures 25 cm.Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)The Spanish painter, graphic artist and sculptor Pablo Picasso created a body of work of about 50,000 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and ceramics. He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from his Blue and Rose period, and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque were the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental painting Guernica (1937), no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. Two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes Picasso's works were for his own lifetime established. Famous for the diversity of its expressions Pablo Picasso is one of the outstanding artists of the 20th century.    Shipping costs excl. statutory VAT and plus 2,5% (+VAT) shipping insurance.

Baer 1326 III B a (von b)  Im Jahr 1959 beginnt Picasso mit einer ersten Serie von farbigen Linolschnitten, die von seinem Drucker Hidalgo Arnéra aus Vallauris hergestellt werden. Er verfeinerte diese Hochdrucktechnik derart, dass er anstelle der Verwendung einer Platte für jeweils eine Farbe nun Farblinolschnitte mit nur einem Druckstock drucken konnte. Mit dem Schwerpunkt auf dem Bildelement der Farbe setzte Picasso den Farblinolschnitt nahezu dem gemalten Bild gleich. Es entstanden zwischen 1959 und 1962 zahlreiche bacchische und bukolische Szenen, Stierkämpfe, Frauenakte und Porträtköpfe. Das Hauptblatt der Linolschnitte wurde jedoch die ""Frauenbüste nach Cranach"" von 1958, das mit seiner feinen Schnittechnik und sorgfältigen Farbwahl der Manier eines Gemäldes nahekommt. Unser Blatt entstand 1962 in der ländlichen Gegend um Mougins, dem letzten Wohnort Picassos. Mit dem Federmesser und dem Hohleisen bearbeitete er die Linoleumplatte und färbte sie anschließend in vier Farben ein. Die abstrahierte Figur an der Quelle lässt sich zunächst schwer einem Frauenkörper zuordnen, zeigt jedoch eine vornübergebeugte Frau mit sonderbaren Körperproportionen.

Working with this technique in his mature creative period, he was able to succeed in combining his drawing skills with a use of rich colors. Le vendangeurs – The grave harvest – is distinguished by its gently running, curved lines, executed in the earthy colors shades of ocher, brown and black.Condition:The sheet is professionally mounted along the upper edge and framed by a mat. It is in very good overall condition. The outside margins of the paper area slightly discolored (covered by the mat), otherwise overall of very good impression. The image measures 53.4 x 64 cm, the sheet dimensions are 62 x 75 cm.Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)The Spanish painter, graphic artist and sculptor Pablo Picasso created a body of work of about 50,000 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and ceramics. He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from his Blue and Rose period, and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque were the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental painting Guernica (1937), no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. Two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes Picasso's works were for his own lifetime established. Famous for the diversity of its expressions Pablo Picasso is one of the outstanding artists of the 20th century.     Shipping costs excl. statutory VAT and plus 2,5% (+VAT) shipping insurance.

"Pablo Picasso, Spanish Art, 1881 - 1973, Le Coq, Crayons, 13x20.5cm, The collection of Innes and Gerard Sassier, France. In 1936 Dora Maar was with Picasso in Mouguins accompanied also by Man Ray and Paul Eluard. They met charming Italian sisters who were working in the Hotel Vaste Horizon. The two were employed by Picasso as cook and chamber maid. Little by little these two girls began to take a prominent part in the life of the painter. Innes married in 1942 with Gustave Sassier and lived, together with their son Gerard, born in 1946, in a small apartment close to the painter at 7 rue des Grandes Augustines in Paris. Innes became a constant companion and friend of the artist. When Picasso moved to the South of France in 1955 Innes looked after the property owned by the artist in Paris and would come down to the south during the school holidays. When the painter sold his Paris apartment in 1967 Innes made the necessary arrangements for the move on Picasso's behalf. Her son, Gerard, says today that the huge house was ""un musee incroyable"" with such a huge quantity of works by Picasso. Innes moved to Mougins where she took the job as chauffeur until 1970 when she left the artist's service. It can be seen that the relationship lasted from 1937 until 1970. Sometimes Innes served as a model and was no doubt privy to all the affairs of Picasso during this period with Dora Maar, Francoise Gillot, Marie-Therese Waller and Jacqueline Picasso. Picasso had two great confidants in his life during this turbulent period: Innes Sassier and Jaume Sabartes. During the time of her acquaintanceship with Picasso Innes was given a number of works consisting of graphics, livres illustrees, autographs, letters and, especially, drawings made by the artist for her son Gerard Sassier. For the most part these consisted of decoupages (or paper cut-outs) showing childish scenes such as circuses, cars and animals.  Accompanied by a certificate of authenticity from Maya Picasso, the artist's daughter.","249: Pablo Picasso, Spanish Art",Thu,21999,20000,30000,17999,2930,Israel,5,339

Sie bilden die größte Gruppe der 100 Radierungen aus den Jahren zwischen 1930 und '37, die Picasso wiederum mit Ambroise Vollard zu einer Suite zusammenstellte. In vielen der Blätter ist ein Bildhauer mit bärtigem Zeuskopf die Hauptfigur[...]. Als Leitmotiv durchzieht die Parallele von sexueller und schöpferischer Potenz die gesamte Suite Vollard. Die Omnipotenz des Künstlers drückt sich dabei häufig auch in der Allgegenwart und Kraft seines Blickes aus. Selbst die Anwesenheit des Bildhauers in seinem überdimensionalen Portraitkopf zeigt noch die Möglichkeit zu verändern und zu verwandeln. Quatre femmes nues et tête sculptée vom 10. März 1934 ist eines der letzten Blätter aus der Suite Vollard''. Die Veränderung der Szene, die von Haremsdarstellungen wie Jean-Dominique Ingres' Le bain turc oder Eugène Delacroix' Femmes d'Alger inspiriert ist, kann anhand der vier erhaltenen Zustände genau verfolgt werden. [...] Es liegt im Rahmen der Suite Vollard nahe, den Skulpturenkopf nicht als Harmeswächter zu betrachten.

"PABLO PICASSO Málaga 1881-1973 Mougins (Spanish)    Le Coq (The Cock)Original Drawing (unsigned)   Title: Le Coq (The Cock)   Technique: Drawing with Harlequin crayon (Crayon with different colours).   Size: 13 x 20,5 cm / 5 x 8 in   Provenance: The collection of Ines and Gerard Sassier, France. In 1936 Dora Maar was with Picasso in Mouguins accompanied also by Man Ray and Paul Eluard. They met charming Italian sisters who were working in the Hotel Vaste Horizon. The two were employed by Picasso as cook and chamber maid. Little by little these two girls began to take a prominent part in the life of the painter. Ines married in 1942 with Gustave Sassier and lived , together with their son Gerard, born in 1946, in a small apartment close to the painter at 7 rue des Grandes Augustines in Paris. Ines became a constant companion and friend of the artist. When Picasso moved to the South of France in 1955 Innes looked after the property owned by the artist in Paris and would come down to the south during the school holidays. When the painter sold his Paris apartment in 1967 Innes made the necessary arrangements for the move on Picasso's behalf. Her son, Gerard, says today that the huge house was ""un musee incroyable"" with such a huge quantity of works by Picasso. Innes moved to Mougins where she took the job as chauffeur until 1970 when she left the artists service. It can be seen that the relationship lasted from 1937 until 1970. Sometimes Innes served as a model and was no doubt privy to all the affairs of Picasso during this period with Dora Maar, Francoise Gillot, Marie-Therese Waller and Jacqueline Picasso. Picasso had two great confidants in his life during this turbulent period: Innes Sassier and Jaume Sabartes. During the time of her acquaintanceship with Picasso Innes was given a number of works consisting of graphics, livres illustrees, autographs, letters and, especially, drawings made by the artist for her son Gerard Sassier. For the most part these consisted of decoupages (or paper cut-outs) showing childish scenes such as circuses, cars and animals. We were fortunate in acquiring a number of works from this source of which this is an example.   Authenticity: A certificate by Maya Picasso, daughter of the artist, accompanies this work.

This is the 66th plate in Picasso's most important series of etchings known as the Suite Vollard and it was realised on the 5th of April 1933.  The Suite Vollard, created between 1930-37, was named after it publisher, the French art dealer and critic Ambroise Vollard. Picasso and Vollard shared a close working relationship up until 1910; however, after this date Vollard was no longer Picasso’s dealer though the two continued to collaborate on publishing projects. In 1930, Vollard, encouraged by the success of two earlier ventures, ambitiously commissioned 100 plates from Picasso and by 1937 the plates were completed and given to master printer Roger Lacouriere to print. The entire edition comprises 3 copies on parchment, 50 copies on larger format Montval paper (50 x 38 cm) and 250 on smaller format Montval paper 44.5 x 34.0). Tragically, Ambroise Vollard died in a car crash 22 July 1939 leaving the project temporarily suspended, until a greater part of the edition was purchased by the print dealer Henri Petiet. After World War II Petiet engaged Picasso to sign a certain number of sets, and this continued up until 1969 but ceased with the publication of the 347 Series. Hence, a large number of the prints from the edition of 250 remain unsigned.

"Pablo Picasso (Spanish; 1881-1973) ""Head of a Man in Broken Lines"" Original Copper Plate & Etching Printed by Lacouriere, Paris From the Carmen Suite W/COAs - This magnificent specimen is an original copper plate created by one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, Pablo Picasso. This plate and etching are a part of the Carmen Suite, created by Picasso while in Paris and remembering his homeland. The collection was inspired by one of the most poignant works in Spanish literature, ""Carmen"" by Prosper Merimee, and consisted of 42 copper plates and 38 etchings, made for an illustrated version of the book, in an extremely limited edition of only 320. The plates were made by Picasso and the etchings were printed either by Picasso, or by Roger Lacourier in Paris. This piece is titled ""Head of a Man in Broken Lines"" and was created by Picasso in 1948. The original etching was printed on wove paper by Roger Lacouriere, and is from the original maquette (proof) for the book edition of 320. This is a stunning piece that truly belongs in a museum, from one of Picasso's greatest collections. This is a once in a lifetime chance to own an original work by arguably one of the most influential and well known artists of all time.

After the auction ends, the winner notification e-mail will include instructions for selecting a carrier and arranging product release to the selected carrier.)    Important notice:  Heritage usually auctions material at the rate of 100-110 lots per hour. On some occasions the Live Auctioneer bid software or the Internet may not be able to keep up with the pace of the auction. We recommend placing a realistic absentee bid now as insurance to avoid disappointment. Occasionally the auctioneer may eliminate or reject a Live Auctioneer Live bid, and the auctioneer may also reopen a lot after the close of the Live Auctioneers live bidding (usually because we missed an audience bid), and may reject your bid even if it shows you as the winning bidder. By bidding via Live Auctioneers, you agree that Heritage may award the lot to another bidder at its sole discretion under the circumstances described above or any other reasonable circumstances. Since Live Auctioneer bids are not shown to us until we open the lot on the floor, we treat those bids just like floor bids. In most cases the floor responds before the Live Auctioneer bid is presented to us, due to Internet lag time, so for consistency we have made it a policy that floor bids are always considered first over tie Live Auctioneer bids. Also please note that all Heritage lots purchased through Live Auctioneers carry a 19.50% Buyer's Premium with a $14 minimum Buyer's Premium. Please make sure you read the Terms and Conditions before you bid. This lot is being auctioned in conjunction with a live floor auction by Heritage Auctions.

"Pablo Picasso (Spanish; 1881-1973) ""Head of a Bull"" Original Copper Plate & Etching Printed by Lacouriere, Paris From the Carmen Suite W/COAs - This magnificent specimen is an original copper plate created by one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, Pablo Picasso. This plate and etching are a part of the Carmen Suite, created by Picasso while in Paris and remembering his homeland. The collection was inspired by one of the most poignant works in Spanish literature, ""Carmen"" by Prosper Merimee, and consisted of 42 copper plates and 38 etchings, made for an illustrated version of the book, in an extremely limited edition of only 320. The plates were made by Picasso and the etchings were printed either by Picasso, or by Roger Lacourier in Paris. This piece is titled ""Head of a Bull"" and was created by Picasso in 1948. The original etching was printed on wove paper by Roger Lacouriere, and is from the original maquette (proof) for the book edition of 320. This is a stunning piece that truly belongs in a museum, from one of Picasso's greatest collections. This is a once in a lifetime chance to own an original work by arguably one of the most influential and well known artists of all time. You will never see a piece like this again, as most people would likely never see anything more than pictures of this master's work in art books. The copper plate is annotated in the lower left ""PARIS 19.11.48.I"", and both will come with individual certificates of authenticity. The plate measures approx. 14"" x 11"", and the etching measures approx. 13"" x 10"". Both pieces will come framed in exhibit quality frames.","Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) ""Head of a Bull""",Sat,19000,95000,125000,9000,352,United States,7,283

NOTE:  This work has been executed across the frontispiece of the book  Notre Dame de Vie, Secrets d'alcÃ´ve d'un atelier  by HÃ©lÃ¨n Parmelin, Ã‰ditions Cercle d'Art, Paris, 1966.  We wish to thank Claude Ruiz-Picasso for kindly providing a certificate of authenticity for this drawing.   Milton S. Fox and Ruby Canfield met in Paris in the 1920s while both there to study art. He came from Cleveland, Ohio, she came from Seattle, Washington. He was enrolled at the Academie Julian then at the Ecole des Beaux-Artes, and she at the Academie Delecluse.    When they returned to the United States, they married and settled in Cleveland, Ohio. Milton joined the Cleveland Museum of Art as a lecturer in the Education Department while also pursuing a career as a portrait painter. Ruby taught puppetry while continuing to paint. They had two children, Robin and Michael Allen.    In 1944, the family moved to Hollywood, California, where Milton worked as a screen writer. Then in 1950 the family moved to New York when Milton joined the newly-formed art book publishing firm, Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers. Abrams was the first American publishing house to specialize in fine art books. Milton remained Editor-in-Chief until his death in 1971, overseeing the texts and production of books. Ruby died four years later.    During the last decades of their lives, Milton and Ruby were able to travel widely in Europe and Japan. During their travels, they created a collection of paintings, scrolls, pottery, and sculpture.

(35 cm.)  Very good condition  Estimate $25,000   This elegantly decorated vase is anthropomorphic in both shape and subject. Depicting a female form, curved and feminine, Picasso delicately paints her face surrounded by decorative details. Inspired by traditional utilitarian vase designs from the South of France, Picasso injects a playful spirit through a circle handle interwoven into the neck of the vase. With perfectly achieved balance, the result is both an artistic and technical achievement.

Inspired by Primitivism and developments in the world around him, Picasso contributed significantly to a number of artistic movements, notably Cubism, Surrealism, Neoclassicism, and Expressionism. Along with Georges Braque, Picasso is best known for pioneering Cubism in an attempt to reconcile three-dimensional space with the two-dimensional picture plane.

Picasso: Catalogue of the Printed Graphic Work, 1904-1967. Berne: Editions Kornfeld & Klipstein, 1968. #220.   Estimate:  $8000 - $12000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were.        Coppel, Stephen.

Impressed by the quality of the resulting works, the artist decided to produce more ceramics in collaboration with Madoura. With his typical, simple, flowing lines the Spanish artist designed here a female portrait on a rectangular plate. Picasso experimented with ceramics and perfected his pottery skills for over 20 years. More than 600 different plates, bowls, vases and jugs in limited edition were created between 1947 and 1971. Today Picasso’s Madoura ceramics are highly sought after by collectors. Condition:The plate is in overall good condition. It shows thin craquelure in the glaze on the underside. The dimensions are 39.5 x 32.2 cm. Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)The Spanish painter, graphic artist and sculptor Pablo Picasso created a body of work of about 50,000 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and ceramics. He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. In 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from his Blue and Rose period and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque marked the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental painting Guernica (1937) no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. In honor of Picasso’s works, two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes, were established during his lifetime.

Note: A group of Italian glass artists (mostly Venetian) formed an association in Murano called the Centro Studio Pittori in the early 1950s. The organization of talented artists worked to render exquisite works of art glass with the assistance of leading art furnaces and the iconic American art patron, Peggy Guggenheim. The Centro Sudio Pittori reached out to noted painters at the time to collaborate with their art to create modern masterworks in glass. In 1954, the association altered their name to Fucina Degli Angeli (Furnace of Angels) and were working with artists such as Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder, Jean Arp, Marc Chagall, and Henry Moore. The artists provided drawings and other projects that the skilled association would render for them in glass by master glass blowers such as Ermanno Nason, Aldo Bon, Albino Carrara, Archimede Seguso and others. The designs after Picasso's drawings were originally conceived in 1947 and originally intended to be rendered in ceramic, later on in the early to mid 1950s, his design was realized in glass.

Dedicated on the back of the magazine ""Island"" in Cuba the day July 7, 1961 and signed P, R. Picasso in Paris.     Pablo Picasso (Spanish1881–1973), was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, stage, poet and playwright who spent most of his adult life in France. As one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and Guernica (1937), a portrayal of the Bombing of Guernica by the German and Italian airforces at the behest of the Spanish nationalist government during the Spanish Civil War.    Picasso, Henri Matisse and Marcel Duchamp are regarded as the three artists who most defined the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts in the opening decades of the 20th century, responsible for significant developments in painting, sculpture, printmaking and ceramics.    Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a realistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. His work is often categorised into periods. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906), the African-influenced Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919).  Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.",PABLO PICASSO (Spanish1881-1973),Wed,15000,20000,35000,10000,1356,United States,3,323

Picasso: Catalogue of the Printed Graphic Work, 1904-1967. Berne: Editions Kornfeld & Klipstein, 1968. #187.   Estimate:  $5000 - $7000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were.        Coppel, Stephen.

Alain Ramié 2; Georges Ramié 670  It was over thirty years ago when we first ventured into the courtyard of the Madoura pottery workshop. We were young and drawn to it by our love of Picasso’s work and the charm and beauty of the south of France. The initial sight of that ancient building with its stone walls and floors; the thick wooden tables covered with pottery, moved us in some profound way. The Madoura ceramics - based both in antiquity and in the designs of Suzanne Ramié were unlike any others we had seen. They had an earthy elegance. And throughout the rooms were the Picasso ceramics - pieces on walls and on tables - plaques, vases, plates and jugs. As we marveled at the pieces we listened to stories told to us by Jeanine and Monique - the two women who had been working there since the time of Picasso. On our first trip we bought a plate and a small tile that was a gift. It was the first of many trips to Vallauris and Madoura. We became familiar with the history, and got to meet and speak with Alain Ramié who shared with us some of his collection of Picasso prints as well as the Picasso pieces that they kept there. Sometimes one of them would surprise us by going into the backroom and bringing forth some special piece that we hadn’t seen before. In all it was a magical wonderful place where the past connected to the present through everything we saw or experienced around us. In the years since we have still retained our love for the ceramics and Madoura. We studied the variations in method and process. We chose pieces that we felt were very strong examples. Our collection was filled with the joie de vivre spirit which permeated Picasso’s Post-War work. We have always been particularly interested in variations, especially as seen in pieces such as Four Enlaced Profiles or the Flute Players or Goat Head in Profile. We hope that those starting out a collection today will feel some of this magical fascination and love for the Picasso ceramics as we have.","1: PABLO PICASSO, Brown/Blue Face, 1947",Wed,14000,9000,12000,6500,2273,United States,6,423

The Suite Vollard, created between 1930-37, was named after it publisher, the French art dealer and critic Ambroise Vollard. Picasso and Vollard shared a close working relationship up until 1910; however, after this date Vollard was no longer Picasso's dealer though the two continued to collaborate on publishing projects. In 1930, Vollard, encouraged by the success of two earlier ventures, ambitiously commissioned 100 plates from Picasso and by 1937 the plates were completed n his Neo-classical style and given to master printer Roger Lacouriere to print. The entire edition comprises 3 copies on parchment, 50 copies on larger format Montval paper (50 x 38 cm) and 250 on smaller format Montval paper 44.5 x 34.0). Tragically, Ambroise Vollard died in a car crash 22 July 1939 leaving the project temporarily suspended, until a greater part of the edition was purchased by the print dealer Henri Petiet. After World War II Petiet engaged Picasso to sign a certain number of sets, and this continued up until 1969 but ceased with the publication of the 347 Series.

Estimate:  $8000 - $12000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were.        Coppel, Stephen.

"PICASSO PABLO: (1881-1973) Spanish Painter. An excellent, original signed and inscribed drawing by Picasso, one page, 8vo, n.p., 11th June 1967. In bold pencil, on a feint ruled sheet removed from an exercise book, the artist has drawn a head and shoulders study of an attractive, slim faced lady with long eyelashes and a string of small flowers in her shoulder length hair. Signed (‘Picasso‘) and inscribed, in French, to a friend at the head of the page, adding the date in his hand beneath his signature. A rare and highly desirable drawing. A thin band of very light discoloration appears to the upper edge, caused by previous mounting to the verso, and only just touches the upper edge of the first letter of Picasso´s inscription, otherwise VG £2000-3000   In the same year that Picasso drew the present sketch, his monumental sculpture the Chicago Picasso, was unveiled in Daley Plaza, Chicago, Illinois. The sculpture, a gift from the artist, initially met with controversy and Picasso never explained what the piece of art represented. However it is widely believed to have been inspired by Sylvette David, a French woman now known as Lydia Corbett, who first posed for Picasso in 1954. The artist made some 40 works inspired by David, and, if this source of inspiration is correct, it could be argued that there are similarities between the long, slender face of the lady in the present drawing and the ‘face’ of the Chicago Picasso.   PABLO PICASSO (1881-1973) Pintor español. Un excelente y original dibujo firmado por  Picasso, con dedicatoria, una página, 8vo, s.l., 11 de junio 1967. Sobre una hoja a rayas levemente impresas y horizontales,  extraída de un libro de ejercicios, el artista dibuja nítidamente a lápiz un retrato de una atractiva mujer de cara delgada con largas pestañas y un collar de pequeñas flores en su cabello largo hasta los hombros. Firmado (“Picasso”) y con dedicatoria en francés a un amigo en el encabezamiento, añadiendo la fecha a mano por debajo de su firma. Un excepcional y muy valioso dibujo. Una delgada linea de muy ligera decoloración aparece en el borde superior causada por anteriores enmarcados en el reverso y que apenas toca el borde superior de la primera letra de la dedicatoria de Picasso, no obstante MB.   En el mismo año que Picasso dibujó este boceto, su monumental escultura El Picasso de Chicago se dio a conocer en la Plaza Daley, Chicago, Illinois. La escultura, un regalo del artista, en un principio fue controvertida y Picasso nunca explicó lo que la obra de arte representaba. Sin embargo, se cree que estuvo inspirada por Sylvette David, una mujer francesa ahora conocida como Lydia Corbett, quien posó por primera vez para Picasso en 1954. El artista hizo unas 40 obras inspiradas en David, y, si esta fuente de inspiración es la correcta, podría argumentarse  que existen similitudes entre la larga y delgada cara de la mujer del presente dibujo  y la “cara” del Picasso de Chicago.    £3800 - 5000",317: PICASSO PABLO: (1881-1973) Spanish Painter.

"Oval ceramic plate  White earthenware with colored enamel and engobe decoration and relief decoration  Vallauris, France, 1952  Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) – Spanish-French painter, sculptor and graphic artist, one of the most important artists, who essentially defined the art of the 20th century  Underside with stamp ‘Madoura Plein Feu/ Empreinte Originale de Picasso’  Catalog raisonné: Georges Bloch no. 34; Alain Ramié no. 145  One from an edition of 250   Dimensions: 31 x 51 x 4.5 cm  Very good state of preservation  Provenance: Private collection, Southern Germany  From the early series of ceramic works that Picasso had made by Madoura in Vallauris; other plates from this series fetch up to €25,000 at international auctions   In the 1950s Pablo Picasso created a series of works with farm and domestic animals. The present ceramic plate, created in collaboration with Madoura in Vallauris, shows a goat, one of Picasso's favorite animals. At this time he even had a goat called Esmeralda as a pet, which he often depicted on plates and jugs. The technique of ‘empreinte originale’, which creates raised lines through carving into the mold and pressing soft clay onto it, allows to render the structure of the rough fur. This plate is from an edition of 250 that were manufactured in June 1952. The beige-colored head with accents in black, blue and light green is rendered on a grayish blue ground. The irregularity of the decoration is probably due to the fact that the ceramics were fired in a wood-fired kiln until 1953, creating beautiful pieces of great expressiveness. Today Picasso’s Madoura ceramics are highly sought after by collectors.The ceramic plate is in flawless condition. It bears an embossed stamp on the underside ‘Madoura Plein Feu/ Empreinte Originale de Picasso’. The dimensions are 31 x 51 x 4.5 cm.Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)Pablo Ruiz Picasso was born in 1881 in the city of Málaga, Spain. He first attended the Art Academy La Llotja in Barcelona and from 1897 onwards the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid, which he quit without graduating. The artist spent the years around the turn of the century in Paris. He established Cubism with his French friend Georges Braque, deeply influencing later avant-garde artists. His painting of 1907 ‘Les Demoiselles d’Avignon’ became the key work of modernism. Picasso left behind an enormous body of work of around 50.000 works of art, comprising paintings, drawings, graphic art, sculptures and pottery. Already during Picasso’s lifetime, two museums were established in his honor: the Museo Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes in Southern France.

The paper bears the Picasso watermark in the bottom half.  It was printed by Lacourière in a limited edition of 260 impressions in 1934 and published by A. Vollard, Paris.  This is one of a small number of impressions from this edition that was hand signed by Picasso.   This etching is from Picasso's most important series of etchings known as the Suite Vollard.  The Suite Vollard, created between 1930-37, was named after it publisher, the French art dealer and critic Ambroise Vollard. Picasso and Vollard shared a close working relationship up until 1910; however, after this date Vollard was no longer Picasso’s dealer though the two continued to collaborate on publishing projects. In 1930, Vollard, encouraged by the success of two earlier ventures, ambitiously commissioned 100 plates from Picasso and by 1937 the plates were completed n his Neo-classical style and given to master printer Roger Lacouriere to print. The entire edition comprises 3 copies on parchment, 50 copies on larger format Montval paper (50 x 38 cm) and 250 on smaller format Montval paper 44.5 x 34.0). Tragically, Ambroise Vollard died in a car crash 22 July 1939 leaving the project temporarily suspended, until a greater part of the edition was purchased by the print dealer Henri Petiet. After World War II Petiet engaged Picasso to sign a certain number of sets, and this continued up until 1969 but ceased with the publication of the 347 Series. Hence, a large number of the prints from the edition of 250 remain unsigned.   Provenance: Galleri Samlaren, Agnes Widlund, Stockholm  Acquired at the above in the 1950's or 1960's.

(29.5 cm.)  Very good condition  Estimate $20,000   While working in the corner of the Musée d’Antibes, Pablo Picasso discovered an injured owl whom he named Paloma. The owl appears most frequently and in more forms and shapes of ceramics than any other animal – with the possible exception of the bull – in Picasso’s oeuvre. “Chouette aux traits” is set apart from Picasso’s other studies of the animal with its painterly quality. Whimsically decorated, the traditional features of a vase are transformed into the owl’s abstracted form.     Pablo Picasso (Spanish, 1881-1973)  A prolific and tireless innovator of art forms, Pablo Picasso impacted the course of 20th-century art with unparalleled magnitude. Inspired by Primitivism and developments in the world around him, Picasso contributed significantly to a number of artistic movements, notably Cubism, Surrealism, Neoclassicism, and Expressionism. Along with Georges Braque, Picasso is best known for pioneering Cubism in an attempt to reconcile three-dimensional space with the two-dimensional picture plane. Picasso’s sizable oeuvre includes over 50,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs.     Condition  In excellent condition.

"Oval ceramic plate  White earthenware with colored enamel and engobe decoration and relief decoration  Vallauris, France, 1952  Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) – Spanish-French painter, sculptor and graphic artist, one of the most important artists, who essentially defined the art of the 20th century  Underside with stamp ‘Madoura Plein Feu/ Empreinte Originale de Picasso’  Catalogue raisonné: Georges Bloch no. 34; Alain Ramié no. 145  One from an edition of 250   Dimensions: 31 x 51 x 4.5 cm  Very good state of preservation  Provenance: Private collection, Southern Germany  From the early series of ceramic works that Picasso had made by Madoura in Vallauris; other plates from this series fetch up to 25,000 euros at international auctions   In the 1950s Pablo Picasso created a series of works with farm and domestic animals. The present ceramic plate, created in collaboration with Madoura in Vallauris, shows a goat, one of Picasso's favorite animals. At this time he even had a goat called Esmeralda as a pet, which he often depicted on plates and jugs. The technique of ‘empreinte originale’, which creates raised lines through carving into the mold and pressing soft clay onto it, allows to render the structure of the rough fur. This plate is from an edition of 250 that were manufactured in June 1952. The beige-colored head with accents in black, blue and light green is rendered on a grayish blue ground. The irregularity of the decoration is probably due to the fact that the ceramics were fired in a wood-fired kiln until 1953, creating beautiful pieces of great expressiveness. Today Picasso’s Madoura ceramics are highly sought after by collectors.The ceramic plate is in flawless condition. It bears an embossed stamp on the underside ‘Madoura Plein Feu/ Empreinte Originale de Picasso’. The dimensions are 31 x 51 x 4.5 cm.Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)Pablo Ruiz Picasso was born in 1881 in the city of Málaga, Spain. He first attended the Art Academy La Llotja in Barcelona and from 1897 onwards the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid, which he quit without graduating. The artist spent the years around the turn of the century in Paris. He established Cubism with his French friend Georges Braque, deeply influencing later avant-garde artists. His painting of 1907 ‘Les Demoiselles d’Avignon’ became the key work of modernism. Picasso left behind an enormous body of work of around 50.000 works of art, comprising paintings, drawings, graphic art, sculptures and pottery. Already during Picasso’s lifetime, two museums were established in his honor: the Museo Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes in Southern France.

He kept his favorite animal, a goat, as a pet. He called her Esmeralda and she appears in many of his ceramic jugs and plates. In his ceramic works he often makes use of the ‘empreinte originale’, a technique that creates the raised lines in the ceramic through carving into the clay casting mold. Picasso created several series of ceramic plates with the goat head as a subject in around 1952. This plate shows the goat’s head in black and white paint and the dark background is adorned with dark blue and light green crosses.The plate is inscribed in underglaze black on the base ‘Edition Picasso’, as well as stamped ‘Madoura Plein Feu/Empreinte Originale de Picasso’. The plate is in very good condition with minimal glaze abrasions on the rim. On the base are two cork stumps for the support.

He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from his Blue and Rose period, and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque were the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental painting Guernica (1937), no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. Two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes Picasso's works were for his own lifetime established. Famous for the diversity of its expressions Pablo Picasso is one of the outstanding artists of the 20th century. (tm)     Shipping costs excl. statutory VAT and plus 2,5% (+VAT) shipping insurance.

"Unique original crayon drawing  France, 1958  Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) – Spanish Cubist painter and printmaker  ‘Tête de Pitre (Clown Head)’  Signed and dated in dark blue crayon upper right ‘Picasso 16.8.58’  Accompanied by a certificate of authenticity  This is a unique original crayon drawing featured in the book ""The Private World of Pablo Picasso"" by David Douglas Duncan  The framed drawing is accompanied by the book  Full margins; framed  Dimensions: 11 x 8 in. (27.9 x 20.3 cm.)  Very good condition  A delightful, colorful face of a clown-like figure graces the title page of ""The Private World of Pablo Picasso"". Written and photographed by David Douglas Duncan over the course of his 6-month stay in Picasso and Jacqueline's home, this book became a collaboration between the three. Intimate yet not intrusive, this book provides amazing insight into the then 75 year artist's world, both personal and professional. With the addition of the clown drawing in crayon by Pablo Picasso himself, one can see how creative and good natured the artist was.   Created on August 18, 1958, this crayon drawing is featured in the book, ""The Private World of Pablo Picasso"", published by Harper &amp; Brothers and written by David Douglas Duncan. It is hand-signed in dark blue crayon by Pablo Picasso in the upper right and also features a hand-written date of '16.6.58.' in dark blue crayon on the right. It is in overall good condition with no evidence of tears or repairs.   Pablo Picasso (Spanish, 1881-1973) A prolific and tireless innovator of art forms, Pablo Picasso impacted the course of 20th-century art with unparalleled magnitude. Inspired by Primitivism and developments in the world around him, Picasso contributed significantly to a number of artistic movements, notably Cubism, Surrealism, Neoclassicism, and Expressionism. Along with Georges Braque, Picasso is best known for pioneering Cubism in an attempt to reconcile three-dimensional space with the two-dimensional picture plane. Picasso’s sizable oeuvre includes over 50,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs.

The paper bears the Picasso watermark in the bottom half.  It was printed by Lacourière in a limited edition of 260 impressions in 1934 and published by A. Vollard, Paris.  This is one of a small number of impressions from this edition that was hand signed by Picasso.  This etching is from Picasso's most important series of etchings known as the Suite Vollard.  The Suite Vollard, created between 1930-37, was named after it publisher, the French art dealer and critic Ambroise Vollard. Picasso and Vollard shared a close working relationship up until 1910; however, after this date Vollard was no longer Picasso’s dealer though the two continued to collaborate on publishing projects. In 1930, Vollard, encouraged by the success of two earlier ventures, ambitiously commissioned 100 plates from Picasso and by 1937 the plates were completed n his Neo-classical style and given to master printer Roger Lacouriere to print. The entire edition comprises 3 copies on parchment, 50 copies on larger format Montval paper (50 x 38 cm) and 250 on smaller format Montval paper 44.5 x 34.0). Tragically, Ambroise Vollard died in a car crash 22 July 1939 leaving the project temporarily suspended, until a greater part of the edition was purchased by the print dealer Henri Petiet. After World War II Petiet engaged Picasso to sign a certain number of sets, and this continued up until 1969 but ceased with the publication of the 347 Series. Hence, a large number of the prints from the edition of 250 remain unsigned.  Provenance: Galleri Samlaren, Agnes Widlund, Stockholm  Acquired at the above in the 1950's or 1960's.

This work was conceived in 1956 and executed in an edition of 100.   In 1946 Picasso in Golfe Juan with his friend Louis Fort, decided to visit the pottery exhibition in Vallauris. He took a particular interest in the Madoura stand and asked to be introduced to the owners - Suzanne and Georges Ramié. They invited him to their Madoura Pottery workshop in Vallauris. There he made three pieces which he left to dry and bake.   A year later Picasso returned to see how the pieces had turned out. He was delighted with the quality of the work and asked if he could make more. They agreed and an area of the workshop was arranged especially for him. Immediately, he began to work, inspired by his portfolio of sketches. So began a long and very productive partnership between Picasso and Madoura. The whole Madoura team became part of the creative process. They made sure Picasso had all the materials he needed and assisted in producing perfectly finished works of art. Suzanne Ramié shared her vast experience, teaching him all the secrets of ceramics.  The ceramics ranged from vases, sculptures, plaques to even a complete dinner service. The familiar themes included bullfighting scenes, portraits and nature - goats, birds, and fish. In 24 years over 633 pieces were created in limited editions all engraved with the Madoura stamp.

Picasso: Catalogue of the Printed Graphic Work, 1904-1967. Berne: Editions Kornfeld & Klipstein, 1968. #218.   Estimate:  $3000 - $5000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were.        Coppel, Stephen.

(26 cm.)  Very good condition   Estimate $10,000-$12,000   After a pivotal meeting with Madoura Pottery creators, Suanne and Georges Ramié, Pablo Picasso created numerous ceramic visions. This richly designed ceramic pitcher with the painted face of a centaur was made by Picasso in 1953 during the collapse of his marriage to Francoise Gilot, the mother cindy centaur, the mythical man/goat creature known for its lustful urges. Picasso’s interest in mythical subjects may have come from the famous Greek ruins in the village of Antibes, where the artist had a summer villa.     Pablo Picasso (Spanish, 1881-1973)  A prolific and tireless innovator of art forms, Pablo Picasso impacted the course of 20th-century art with unparalleled magnitude. Inspired by Primitivism and developments in the world around him, Picasso contributed significantly to a number of artistic movements, notably Cubism, Surrealism, Neoclassicism, and Expressionism. Along with Georges Braque, Picasso is best known for pioneering Cubism in an attempt to reconcile three-dimensional space with the two-dimensional picture plane.

Picasso: Catalogue of the Printed Graphic Work, 1904-1967. Berne: Editions Kornfeld & Klipstein, 1968. #198.   Estimate:  $3000 - $5000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were.        Coppel, Stephen.

It was printed in 1968 by  the Crommelynck brothers in France and published by Gallerie Louise Leiris, Paris in an edition of 50 signed and numbered impressions.  The paper bears the ""Rives"" watermark on the the lower right part.   The “347 Series” was, in printmaking, the undertaking which defined late Picasso. This prodigious outpouring of work, dating from March 16th–October 5th, 1968, deals with all of his old themes and fantasies, adding an obsession newly central in the late 60s, the artist as voyeur. It is in this role, rather than that of a protagonist, that the artist figures in these fantastic narrations.  In order to be able to work with full freedom and concentration, Picasso had his printers, the brothers Crommelynck, bring the etching plates and hand press to his farmhouse near Cannes.   The full title of this work is 'Écrivain avec son égérie, travaillant à un conte du genre mille et une nuits où il est question d'un cabaliste au hibou, d'un jeune homme et d'une hétaire'(Writer with his Muse Composing a Tale Similar to the Thousand and One Nights, Relating to a Cabalist and his Owl, a Young Man and a Courtesan).

However, the simplicity of inking is intentional, linocut ink is a thick oily substance and repels water, Picasso discovered that if he printed in white ink and then over worked the printed area in a black water-based ink he could create an almost negative image. The process was simple, Picasso took the printed sheets and rinsed them in the shower, hence the term rincée, washing the black ink from the oil-based white ink leaving only the merest traces of the black in the unprinted areas. The Rincée linocuts are some of the artist's most playful and technically unusual works, in general they were one offs produced as experimental artist's proofs, the present lot is one of the very few Rincée linocuts that was produced in an edition.   δ This lot is sold subject to Artists Resale Rights, details of which can be found in our Terms and Conditions.",&#948; Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)  L'&#201;treinte II,Mon,10622,6639,9295,5842,21,United Kingdom,6,255

"PICASSO PABLO: (1881-1973) Spanish Painter. An extremely rare three colour proof for artist or printer of Portrait de Jacqueline (“Jacqueline´s Portrait”) by Picasso, 12th April 1956, signed and inscribed by Picasso to the bottom left corner to his friend and artist Manfredo Borsi `Pour mon cher Borsi, son ami, Picasso´ (“to my dear Borsi, his friend, Picasso”). The present copy being almost certainly one of the proofs for artist or printer done in 1956, offered to his colleague, and therefore do not bear the number of the one hundred numbered lithographs signed by the artist. The three colour drawing being black, blue and brown. The signature and inscription being in red pencil, the first underlined in red and blue pencil. The present document size being in full 19.8 x 26,1, (50,2cm x 66,4cm), while the drawing portrait and date sizes are 15.3 x 20.4, (39cm x 52cm). VG   £8000-12000    €10000 - 15000Portrait de Jacqueline (“Jacqueline´s Portrait”) is a lithograph by Picasso, done in Cannes, on 4th December 1956. Portrait de Jacqueline was initially intended as a poster for the Picasso exhibition “Un demi siècle de livres illustrés” (“Half a century of picture books”) at the Matarasso Gallery in Nice, 21st December 1956 to 31st January 1957. At the last moment, Picasso started over and executed a second magnificent three colour portrait of Jacqueline. Picasso worked right side out in lithographic crayon on three zincs which Matarasso brought to him. The run was executed on an offset press in Marseille, which explains why the image and the date are right reading, whereas in a non-offset lithograph run the printing would be reversed. A few proofs were done for the artist and printer in various colours. A hundred impressions of the lithograph Portrait de Jacqueline numbered and signed by Picasso were issued. Jacqueline Roque (1927-1986) Second wife of Picasso 1961-73 until the artist´s death. Jacqueline Picasso killed herself by gunshot in 1986 when she was 59 years old. A muse and source of inspiration of Picasso who created over 400 portraits of her. Pablo Picasso met Jacqueline in Vallauris, French Riviera, in 1953, she was 26 years old and he was 72. He romanced her by drawing a dove on her house in chalk and bringing her one rose a day until she agreed to date him six months later. They married in 1961.It is likely that Picasso's series of paintings derived from Delacroix´s The Women of Algiers was inspired by Roque. The artist commented that `Delacroix had already met Jacqueline´.After Picasso's death in 1973, Françoise Gilot, Pablo´s companion 1943-53, and mother of his two children, contested the will in favour of Roque on the grounds that Picasso was mentally ill. Provenance, the present document was offered by Picasso to his friend Manfredo Borsi in 1957 during a visit of the last to Picasso in Vallauris, and has been kept since by Borsi´s wife family Bianca Valentini Borsi, belonging today to her sister by inheritance. Manfredo Borsi (1900-1967) Italian Painter, Ceramicist and Lithographer. Borsi was graduated in the Florence academy of Arts, specialized in enamel ceramics. Borsi met Picasso in the 20´s in Paris and both became friends. Both moved to the south of France, Picasso to Vallauris, while Borsi moved to St Paul de Vence.Accompanied by a certificate issued and signed by Claude Picasso confirming that the lithograph is authentically signed and inscribed by Picasso.

He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. In 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from hisBlue and Rose period and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque marked the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The paintingLes Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental paintingGuernica(1937) no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. In honor of Picasso’s works, two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes, were established during his lifetime. Famous for the diversity of his expressions, Pablo Picasso is one of the outstanding artists of the 20th century.

It was conceived in 1948 in an edition of 450.  It is a partially glazed white ceramic platter, with black slip, painted in colors. Picasso created thousands of ceramic pieces between 1947-1971, some of which (like ours) were produced in limited numbers and with exclusive rights by Madoura Pottery in Vallauris, where Suzanne and Georges Ramié welcomed him in July 1946.  Picasso tackled ceramics with his genius and prodigious creative imagination, under the close initiation of Suzanne Ramié who provided him with her vast knowledge of the tricks of the craft.  Then it came to pass that after an intense period of work, he sought the ability to repeat certain of his works.  It was then essential to transpose into ceramic reality the method already put into practice in graphic art, but for this new application, the basis of the graphic design originated from very different principles.  This particular difficulty was solved by adopting two methods, whose various techniques were carefully examined:  1st: the authentic replica of an original by exact repeating of volumes and illuminations.  2nd: the transfer from an original subject engraved on a hardened plaster matrix, by applying a fresh sheet to take clay impression.

He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. In 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from hisBlue and Rose period and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque marked the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The paintingLes Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental paintingGuernica(1937) no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. In honor of Picasso’s works, two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes, were established during his lifetime. Famous for the diversity of his expressions, Pablo Picasso is one of the outstanding artists of the 20th century.    Shipping costs excl. statutory VAT and plus 2,5% (+VAT) shipping insurance.

"PICASSO PABLO: (1881-1973) Spanish Painter. An extremely rare three colour proof for artist or printer of Portrait de Jacqueline (''JacquelineÂ´s Portrait'') by Picasso, 12th April 1956, signed and inscribed by Picasso to the bottom left corner to his friend and artist Manfredo Borsi `Pour mon cher Borsi, son ami, PicassoÂ´ (''to my dear Borsi, his friend, Picasso''). The present copy being almost certainly one of the proofs for artist or printer done in 1956, offered to his colleague, and therefore do not bear the number of the one hundred numbered lithographs signed by the artist. The three colour drawing being black, blue and brown. The signature and inscription being in red pencil, the first underlined in red and blue pencil. The present document size being in full 19.8 x 26,1, (50,2cm x 66,4cm), while the drawing portrait and date sizes are 15.3 x 20.4, (39cm x 52cm). VG   Â£5000-8000       Portrait de Jacqueline (''JacquelineÂ´s Portrait'') is a lithograph by Picasso, done in Cannes, on 4th December 1956. Portrait de Jacqueline was initially intended as a poster for the Picasso exhibition ''Un demi siÃ¨cle de livres illustrÃ©s'' (''Half a century of picture books'') at the Matarasso Gallery in Nice, 21st December 1956 to 31st January 1957. At the last moment, Picasso started over and executed a second magnificent three colour portrait of Jacqueline. Picasso worked right side out in lithographic crayon on three zincs which Matarasso brought to him. The run was executed on an offset press in Marseille, which explains why the image and the date are right reading, whereas in a non-offset lithograph run the printing would be reversed. A few proofs were done for the artist and printer in various colours.  A hundred impressions of the lithograph Portrait de Jacqueline numbered and signed by Picasso were issued.  Jacqueline Roque (1927-1986) Second wife of Picasso 1961-73 until the artistÂ´s death. Jacqueline Picasso killed herself by gunshot in 1986 when she was 59 years old. A muse and source of inspiration of Picasso who created over 400 portraits of her. Pablo Picasso met Jacqueline in Vallauris, French Riviera, in 1953, she was 26 years old and he was 72. He romanced her by drawing a dove on her house in chalk and bringing her one rose a day until she agreed to date him six months later. They married in 1961.  It is likely that Picasso's series of paintings derived from DelacroixÂ´s The Women of Algiers was inspired by Roque. The artist commented that `Delacroix had already met JacquelineÂ´.  After Picasso's death in 1973, FranÃ§oise Gilot, PabloÂ´s companion 1943-53, and mother of his two children, contested the will in favour of Roque on the grounds that Picasso was mentally ill.  Provenance, the present document was offered by Picasso to his friend Manfredo Borsi in 1957 during a visit of the last to Picasso in Vallauris, and has been kept since by BorsiÂ´s wife family Bianca Valentini Borsi, belonging today to her sister by inheritance.  Manfredo Borsi (1900-1967) Italian Painter, Ceramicist and Lithographer. Borsi was graduated in the Florence academy of Arts, specialized in enamel ceramics. Borsi met Picasso in the 20Â´s in Paris and both became friends. Both moved to the south of France, Picasso to Vallauris, while Borsi moved to St Paul de Vence.

In the following years till Picasso's death many etchings such as the extensive ‘Series 347’ originated there. The present aquatint etching in colors, too, was created after a painting by Picasso in Atelier Crommelynck.  Condition:The sheet is somewhat wavy and slightly toned within the mat-window.

The plate measures 32.4 x 43.5 cm, the sheet 50.3 x 66.5 cm. The framed dimensions are 64 x 74.5 cm.  Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)The Spanish painter, graphic artist and sculptor Pablo Picasso created a body of work of about 50,000 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and ceramics. He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from his Blue and Rose period, and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque were the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental painting Guernica (1937), no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. Two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes Picasso's works were for his own lifetime established. Famous for the diversity of its expressions Pablo Picasso is one of the outstanding artists of the 20th century. (fea)    Shipping costs excl. statutory VAT and plus 2,5% (+VAT) shipping insurance.

"Pablo Picasso Chouette Femme (Woman Owl), 1951 Ceramic Vase. Using a standard symmetrical vase form, Picasso complicates the shape by adding a cropped cylinder to the center back portion of Pablo Picasso ceramic Chouette Femme (Woman Owl), 1951. This interesting design choice is incorporated into the decoration, as Picasso uses the cropped cylinder to become the pinned back hair of the “Owl Woman.” Picasso’s merging of the female and animal forms is typical of his signature style, as he continued to explore transformative properties of the female figure throughout his career. The face is rendered in broad, sweeping brushstrokes that create stark features. The face looks human – there is little owl in the front of the vase. The use of this shape of vase, which is so often used to depict owls, plays with the expectations of the viewer. In addition to this, when viewed from the back, the strands of the woman’s pulled-back hair looks like the folded wings of an owl. This masterful vase holds both the characteristics of a woman and an owl. The decoration, done exclusively in black on a white enamel plane, is truly beautiful. Created in 1951, this original turned vase of white earthenware clay, engobe and paraffin decoration, white enamel with black. Inscribed stamps on the underside of the ceramic, ‘MADOURA PLEIN FEU’ and ‘EDITION PICASSO’.

Accompanied with certificate of attribution from International Art Society, Galeri d'art, Luxumbourg. A prolific and tireless innovator of art forms, Pablo Picasso impacted the course of 20th-century art with unparalleled magnitude. Inspired by African and Iberian art and developments in the world around him, Picasso contributed significantly to a number of artistic movements, notably Cubism, Surrealism, Neoclassicism, and Expressionism. Along with Georges Braque, Picasso is best known for pioneering Cubism in an attempt to reconcile three-dimensional space with the two-dimensional picture plane, once asking, â€œAre we to paint whatâ€™s on the face, whatâ€™s inside the face, or whatâ€™s behind it?â€ Responding to the Spanish Civil War, he painted his most famous work, Guernica (1937), whose violent images of anguished figures rendered in grisaille made it a definitive work of anti-war art. â€œPainting is not made to decorate apartments,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s an offensive and defensive weapon against the enemy.â€ Picassoâ€™s sizable oeuvre includes over 20,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs.

Picasso: Catalogue of the Printed Graphic Work, 1904-1967. Berne: Editions Kornfeld & Klipstein, 1968. #157.   Estimate:  $3000 - $5000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were.        Coppel, Stephen.

It is dated in the plate 18.9.68.III.   It was printed in 1968 by the Crommelynck Brothers in France and published by Gallerie Louise Leiris, Paris in an edition of 50 signed and numbered impressions.  In addition there were 17 artist’s proof, and ours is one of these rare proofs.  Note: The “347 Series” was, in printmaking, the undertaking which defined late Picasso. This prodigious outpouring of work, dating from March 16th–October 5th, 1968, deals with all of his old themes and fantasies, adding an obsession newly central in the late 60s, the artist as voyeur. It is in this role, rather than that of a protagonist, that the artist figures in these fantastic narrations.  In order to be able to work with full freedom and concentration, Picasso had his printers, the brothers Crommelynck, bring the etching plates and hand press to his farmhouse near Cannes.  Provenance: The artist.  Marina Picasso, the artist's granddaughter (by descent)  Marina Picasso, (born in Cannes 1951) is the granddaughter of Pablo Picasso and the Ballets Russes dancer Olga Kokhlova.

Her personal collection of Picasso's work includes about 400 paintings, more than 7,000 sketches and drawings and sculptures. This collection was the private holding of Picasso art which she inherited.  The work bears the stamp of Marina Picasso collection verso ""Succ. Pablo Picasso - Coll. Marina Picasso"" (Lugt 3698).  The stamp was created by the New York Jan Krugier Gallery, who are the exclusive agents of the Marina Picasso collection.

Literatur: Der gesamte Satz Platten bei: A. Ramié, Nr. 416-423. Provenienz: Rheinische Privatsammlung. Bereits in jungen Jahren kam Pablo Picasso mit dem Thema des Stierkampfes in Berührung und übernahm es in seiner Kunst. Seine Faszination wurde angeregt durch Besuche von Stierkämpfen. Sie hielt die gesamte Schaffensperiode des vielseitig begabten Künstlers an und manifestierte sich in den verschiedenen Gattungen wie der Malerei, der Druckgraphik oder der Keramik, in denen er arbeitete. Picasso soll sich selbst mit einem tapferen Picador identifiziert haben. Ein Besuch in der Madoura Töpferei in Vallauris in Frankreich 1947 weckte das Interesse des Spaniers an der Keramik. Picasso schuf dort seine ersten Arbeiten in Keramik. Bereits zu diesem Zeitpunkt taucht der Stierkampf in seinen Editionen auf. Zwölf Jahre später entstand das Service ''Scènes de Corrida', aus dem die beiden hier angebotenen Platten stammen. Picasso fertigte acht verschiedene Platten für das Service, die allesamt Szenen des Stierkampfes darstellen. Die erste hier angebotene Platte zeigt eine großflächig aufgetragene weiße Glasur über welcher sich der Stierkampf abspielt. Malerische blaue und braune Farbfelder führen zu den in dunkelblauen Tupfern aufgetragenen Personen und Stier. Im oberen Bereich der Platte wird die Publikumstribüne angedeutet. Die zweite Komposition konzentriert sich auf den Matador im Kampf mit dem Stier. Spielerisch akzentuiert der Künstler hier die Komposition mit Farbfeldern aus blauer, gelber und brauner Glasur auf weißem Untergrund. Auch bei diesem Exempel sorgen dunkelblaue Tupfer für die Hervorhebung der Handlung des Stierkampfes.",PABLO PICASSO 1881 Málaga - 1973 Mougins KERAMIKPLATTE:,Sat,7300,4492,4942,4492,660,Germany,8,301

"Ceramic jug  White earthenware with colored engobe decoration and glazed on the inside  Vallauris, France, 1955  Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) – Spanish-French painter, sculptor and graphic artist, one of the most important artists, who essentially defined the art of the 20th century  Underside inscribed ‘Edition Picasso’ with stamps ‘Madoura Plein Feu’ and ‘d’après Picasso’  Catalogue raisonné: Alain Ramié no. 297  One from an edition of 100  Height: 33 cm  Very good state of preservation  Provenance: Private collection, Southern Germany  From the early series of ceramic works that Picasso had made by Madoura in Vallauris; other pitchers from this series fetch up to 15,000 euros at international auctions  In 1946 Pablo Picasso visited the ceramic workshop Madoura in Vallauris where he attended a pottery class. Impressed by the quality of the resulting works, the artist decided to produce more ceramics in collaboration with Madoura. Inspired by ancient terracotta ‘tanagra’ figurines, Picasso had the idea to create a series of standing, kneeling and seated female figures in 1947. The present pitcher is part of an edition of 100 pieces that were manufactured in 1955. There are two variants: one with the women wearing modern clothing and pearl jewelry, or, like here, dressed in a daring swimsuit. The blue-gray cape and the delicate face are presented with simple, flowing lines. Picasso experimented with ceramics and perfected his pottery skills for over 20 years. 633 different plates, bowls, vases and jugs in limited edition were created between 1947 and 1971. Today Picasso’s Madoura ceramics are highly sought after by collectors.The ceramic jug is in flawless condition. It is inscribed ‘Edition Picasso’ and bears the stamps ‘Madoura Plein Feu’ and ‘d’après Picasso’ on the underside. The height is 33 cm.Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)Pablo Ruiz Picasso was born in 1881 in the city of Málaga, Spain. He first attended the Art Academy La Llotja in Barcelona and from 1897 onwards the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid, which he quit without graduating. The artist spent the years around the turn of the century in Paris. He established Cubism with his French friend Georges Braque, deeply influencing later avant-garde artists. His painting of 1907 ‘Les Demoiselles d’Avignon’ became the key work of modernism. Picasso left behind an enormous body of work of around 50.000 works of art, comprising paintings, drawings, graphic art, sculptures and pottery. Already during Picasso’s lifetime, two museums were established in his honor: the Museo Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes in Southern France.

"Measures 12 inches in height. Composed, 1969. Signed, underside 9/1/69 - Numbered 228 of 350. Edition Picasso, Madoura.Pablo Picasso (1881-1973). The foremost figure in 20th-century art.  Leader of the School of Paris, he was known for his technical virtuosity, and originality. His production is usually described in series of overlapping periods.  In his melancholy blue period such works as The Old Guitarist (1903; Art Inst., Chicago) depicted, in blue tones, the world of the poor.  His rose period is characterized by a lighter palette and subjects from the circus.  In 1907, Picasso painted Les Demoiselles d' Avignon (Mus. Mod. Art, N. Y.C.), the most significant work in the development of Cubism and abstraction, and a herald of analytic cubism. In the synthetic phase of cubism (after 1912), his forms became larger and more representational, e.g., The Three Musicians (1921; Mus. Mod. Art, N. Y.C.).  In the 1920s he also introduced collage.  His second landmark work was Guernica (Reina Sofa, MadridCentro de Arte Reina Sofa), an impassioned condemnation of war and fascism.

Picasso: Catalogue of the Printed Graphic Work, 1904-1967. Berne: Editions Kornfeld & Klipstein, 1968. #169.   Estimate:  $3000 - $5000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were.        Coppel, Stephen.

"Ca. 1960, 202 x 152 cm, France   This modern rug was woven to an original design by Pablo Picasso (1881 MÃ¡laga - 1973 Mougins). It is executed in restrained colours. The ochre surface in the lower section of the picture represents a table on which a large vase has been placed before the background of a chamois wall. A wide black band at the right-hand side of the field cuts across the right edge of the table, defining a certain sense of perspective. Shaped like a snail shell, the green vase is decorated with a black spiral enclosing a white star to suggest a rotary movement. The square neck with its circular opening points diagonally to the left. Picasso designed the abstract composition with a breathtaking confidence. The palette evokes the rooms of the potteries of Vallauris, where he devoted himself to ceramic art with abandon in the post-war period. This is where the cartoon for the carpet must have been designed on 11th March 1947. In any case, this is the date shown in the bottom left-hand corner of an identical example recently sold at auction in Paris (Millon auction, Paris, 21/11/2012, lot 77). Marie Cuttoli (1879 Algeria -1973 Paris) commissioned carpets to this design ca. 1960. Our example was illustrated in a 1961 catalogue of Ernst Beyeler's famous Basel gallery. This is where the consignor purchased the carpet on 9th November 1965 (information supplied courtesy of Dr. Ulf Küster, Fondation Beyeler, Riehen). Marie Cuttoli was one of the most important representatives of modern 20th century textile art. As early as 1910, she revived carpet weaving in Algeria and trained local weavers. The weavings were displayed in Paris haute couture companies. In 1925 she opened Maison Myrbor in a Paris palais owned by Jean Lurçat. The most important designers of her time made use of her embroideries and appliqué work. As early as 1927 she produced tapestries for Braque, Léger, MirÃ³ and Picasso. Since then a close lifelong friendship united her with Pablo Picasso. Next to Man Ray and Jean Cocteau, Marie Cuttoli belonged to the artist's inner circle. After her death, Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé moved into her famous salon in the rue de Babylon 55. A woven inscription, PICASSO, on the reverse. A stitched-on fabric label reads: Made in France. Executed ca. 1960 together with Lucie Weill (Les Tapis de MaÃ®tre Galerie Lucie Weill-Seligman). Condition as new.

In August 1947, revisiting the Madoura pottery of the ceramists Georges and Suzanne Ramie at Vallauris, near Antibes, he [Picasso] is delighted to see that the small figures he had casually modeled there the year before have been fired. This begins an intense interest in ceramics, which occupies him for more than a year. In 1948 he settles in the small villa La Galloise, later taking over an abandoned perfume factory for painting, sculpture, and graphics studios. In November 1948 a large ceramics exhibition is held at La Mansion de la Pensee Francaise, Paris. Picasso has continued an enormous production in ceramics, including both sculpture and decorative bowls, plates, tiles, and urns of infinite variety.   12 in.     30.48 cm      Legg, Alicia.

(13.3 x 36.2 cm.)  Very good condition  Estimate $6,000-$8,000 While working in the corner of the Musée d’Antibes, Pablo Picasso discovered an injured owl, whom he tamed. Named Paloma, the owl went with the artist whenever he moved between Paris and the Côte d’Azur. The owl appears most frequently and in more forms and shapes of ceramics than any other animal – with the possible exception of the bull – in Picasso’s oeuvre. This “Petite Chouette” is in the form of a small pitcher with playful designs. The unglazed outside and glazed interior keeps water from seeping into this porous material.   Executed in 1949, this partially glazed ceramic pitcher is stamped, from the edition of two hundred. It measures 5 ¼ inches in height. Minor scuffs on base, typical of the material. Otherwise in overall good condition.   Pablo Picasso (Spanish, 1881-1973) A prolific and tireless innovator of art forms, Pablo Picasso impacted the course of 20th-century art with unparalleled magnitude. Inspired by Primitivism and developments in the world around him, Picasso contributed significantly to a number of artistic movements, notably Cubism, Surrealism, Neoclassicism, and Expressionism. Along with Georges Braque, Picasso is best known for pioneering Cubism in an attempt to reconcile three-dimensional space with the two-dimensional picture plane. Picasso’s sizable oeuvre includes over 50,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs which can be found in public and private collections worldwide.

Picasso: Catalogue of the Printed Graphic Work, 1904-1967. Berne: Editions Kornfeld & Klipstein, 1968. #180.   Estimate:  $3000 - $5000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were.        Coppel, Stephen.

Pablo Ruiz y Picasso, also known as Pablo Picasso (/p??k??so?, -?kso?/;[2] Spanish: [?pa?lo pi?kaso]; 25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973), was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, stage designer, poet and playwright who spent most of his adult life in France.

Regarded as one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture,[3][4] the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and Guernica (1937), a portrayal of the Bombing of Guernica by the German and Italian airforces at the behest of the Spanish nationalist government during the Spanish Civil War.",Pablo Picasso(1881-1973) Oil on canvas,Tue,5500,800000,1000000,1000,601,United States,5,158

Estimate:  $3000 - $5000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were.        Coppel, Stephen.

Estimate:  $3000 - $5000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures.

It is painted and and partially glazed earthenware bowl.  The work is stamped 'Madoura Plein Feu/Empreinte Originale de Picasso' underneath.   It is dated '21.11.54' in the upper right part.   It was conceived on 21 November 1954 in Vallauris and executed in a limited edition of 100 pieces.  Picasso used for this work a round cup with white earthenware. The engraving was underlined with oxidized paraffin in covered bath. Beneath black enamel. Ivory, brown, green, black, bronze    Picasso created many ceramic pieces between 1947-1971, some of which (like ours) were produced in limited numbers and with exclusive rights by Madoura Pottery in Vallauris, where Suzanne and Georges Ramié welcomed him in July 1946.  Picasso tackled ceramics with his genius and prodigious creative imagination, under the close initiation of Suzanne Ramié who provided him with her vast knowledge of the tricks of the craft.  Then it came to pass that after an intense period of work, he sought the ability to repeat certain of his works.  It was then essential to transpose into ceramic reality the method already put into practice in graphic art, but for this new application, the basis of the graphic design originated from very different principles.  This particular difficulty was solved by adopting two methods, whose various techniques were carefully examined:  1st: the authentic replica of an original by exact repeating of volumes and illuminations.  2nd: the transfer from an original subject engraved on a hardened plaster matrix, by applying a fresh sheet to take clay impression.

Picasso: Catalogue of the Printed Graphic Work, 1904-1967. Berne: Editions Kornfeld & Klipstein, 1968. #195.   Estimate:  $3000 - $5000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures.

An exceptional vintage signed and inscribed 7 x 9 photograph of Picasso standing outdoors in a half length pose wearing an overcoat, scarf and with a plain dark beret upon his head.

A very fine signed portrait with an excellent association. Lightly mounted and professionally and handsomely matted in white and framed and glazed in a plain, light coloured wooden frame to an overall size of 20.5 x 24.5. VG       Jaime Sabartes (1881-1968) Catalan Spanish Artist, Poet and Writer. Sabartes was a close personal friend of Picasso whom he first met in 1899 (the same year in which Picasso painted his first portrait of Sabartes). In 1935 Sabartes became Picasso's secretary and administrator, organising his papers, books and poems, as well as taking responsibility for arranging exhibitions. Sabartes collected a great many works by Picasso which he donated to the Museu Picasso in Barcelona in 1963 forming the core of this gallery which was initially known as the Sabartes collection. His books and papers were donated to the Museo Picasso in Málaga. The inscription on the present photograph translates as 'For Jaime Sabartes, this photograph was made in Tolosa where we were together this winter, Picasso'.       Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years and went on to create art in a variety of mediums (paintings, sculptures, ceramics) and also worked as a stage designer, poet and playwright. One of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century, he is remembered for co-founding the Cubist movement.

Measures 9 x 9.5 inches.   Provenance: The estate of mid-20th century Kansas City architect David Benton Runnells (1913 - 1973).    According to Mrs. Runnells' diary, on May 14, 1959 they visited the Pablo Picasso workshop showroom on the French Riviera and purchased this double spout pitcher, Figure de Proue.   The Runnells family was in Europe from August of 1958 to August of 1959 while David taught at the Vienna Technical University on a Fulbright Fellowship in Vienna, Austria.   David Runnells was a Kansas City architect whose biography reads like the Five W's of Modern Design. After graduating the University of Illinois, Runnells discovered Finnish architect and designer Alvar Aalto while studying at the University of Stockholm on scholarship. Around 1940, he attended Cranbrook Academy of Art and studied under Finnish Architects, Eliel and Eero Saarinen. Following graduation from Cranbrook he stayed on to work with the Saarinens on projects that included the groundbreaking architecture of  Crow Island School in Winnetka, Illinois. After Cranbrook he became head of the industrial-design department at the Kansas City Art Institute. From 1943 to 1946 he was director of planning for the Kansas City Planning Department. He then entered private practice and designed the art-school building for the Kansas City Art Institute with fellow Cranbrook alum George Matsumoto. After teaching in Austria he started a private firm in Kansas City and completed many projects with modern design builder Don Drummond who, in the words of KCMODERN.COM, ""pioneered modern residential architecture in Kansas City, Missouri.""    The attached photograph, taken by Charlie Eames in 1941 on the steps at Cranbrook pictures David Runnells, Art Brewer, Eliel Saarinen, Avely Winter, Eero Saarinen, Jerry Schilling and Ed Lenders.

"Measures 15 inches diameter. Created 1957. Signed on verso, no. 107. Numbered 132/150.Pablo Picasso (1881-1973). The foremost figure in 20th-century art.  Leader of the School of Paris, he was known for his technical virtuosity, and originality. His production is usually described in series of overlapping periods.  In his melancholy blue period such works as The Old Guitarist (1903; Art Inst., Chicago) depicted, in blue tones, the world of the poor.  His rose period is characterized by a lighter palette and subjects from the circus.  In 1907, Picasso painted Les Demoiselles d' Avignon (Mus. Mod. Art, N. Y.C.), the most significant work in the development of Cubism and abstraction, and a herald of analytic cubism. In the synthetic phase of cubism (after 1912), his forms became larger and more representational, e.g., The Three Musicians (1921; Mus. Mod. Art, N. Y.C.).  In the 1920s he also introduced collage.  His second landmark work was Guernica (Reina Sofa, MadridCentro de Arte Reina Sofa), an impassioned condemnation of war and fascism. In his later years, Picasso turned to creations of fantasy and comic invention.","Pablo Picasso - Ceramic Platter - Bull, 1957",Sun,5000,5000,10000,2500,267,United States,8,179

Good condition   Estimate $5,000-$7,000 Portraying an abstracted squab, this linocut by Pablo Picasso demonstrates the boundaries of this printmaking technique. By using linoleum, the artist is able to create lines of varying thickness and directions, giving this work a strong sense of dimensionality. Picasso uses the medium to create multiple picture planes within one surface, using line to create form.   Executed in 1939, this linocut on wove paper is signed and numbered two hundred and eleven from an edition of two hundred and twenty-six. From the deluxe edition of “40 Dessins de Picasso en Marge du Buffon” the work was published in 1957 by Jonquières and Berggruen, Paris. With full margins and deckled edges, the sheet measures 14 ½ x 11 inches. Scattered pale stains in lower margins, slightest toning, otherwise in good condition.

Inspired by Primitivism and developments in the world around him, Picasso contributed significantly to a number of artistic movements, notably Cubism, Surrealism, Neoclassicism, and Expressionism. Along with Georges Braque, Picasso is best known for pioneering Cubism in an attempt to reconcile three-dimensional space with the two-dimensional picture plane.

It is dated in the plate 18.9.68.II.   It was printed in 1968 by the Crommelynck Brothers in France and published by Gallerie Louise Leiris, Paris in an edition of 50 signed and numbered impressions.  The â€œ347 Seriesâ€ was, in printmaking, the undertaking which defined late Picasso. This prodigious outpouring of work, dating from March 16thâ€“October 5th, 1968, deals with all of his old themes and fantasies, adding an obsession newly central in the late 60s, the artist as voyeur. It is in this role, rather than that of a protagonist, that the artist figures in these fantastic narrations.  In order to be able to work with full freedom and concentration, Picasso had his printers, the brothers Crommelynck, bring the etching plates and hand press to his farmhouse near Cannes.

The work is hand numbered in pencil ""F 42/250"" at the lower left corner and dated in the plate ""21.2.69"" above the signature.  Two editions of the lithographs exist: The ""A"" edition and the ""F"" edition. Each consists of 250 impressions and numbered 1-250. The ""A"" edition was reserved for America and the ""F"" edition was reserved for France.   Our impression is from the French edition.   The work was printed by Marcel Salinas and published by Harry N. Abrams, Inc., New York.  The paper has a stamp on the bottom right margin verso, stating in French that this lithograph was executed by Marecel Salinas after a painting on cardboard by PicassoTBC.     In early 1969, art supplies arrived at Picasso's studio in Mougins on the French Riviera.   Large panels of cardboard had been used to ship the supplies. The supplies were uncrated and the boxes and other shipping materials were set aside against a wall in Picasso's studio.   Rather than seeing large pieces of cardboard, Picasso saw 29 canvases awaiting his brush, and at the age of 87 he created 29 portraits which would come to be known as the Portraits Imaginaire or Imaginairy Portraits. Each portrait was created in gouache with simple and brilliant colours.   Under Picasso's personal supervision, and with the expertise of one of France's leading lithographers, Marcel Salinas, lithographs were created in the image of the 29 original Portraits Imaginaire.   Proofs of the lithographs were submitted to Picasso who corrected them and noted his ""bon a tirer"" (meaning they were ""good to print"").   It took a year to create the lithographs. Upon completion, the plates were destroyed.   Each print is hand numbered and carries, in the plate, the signature of Picasso as it appears on the orginal gouache. Picasso did not hand sign any of the Portraits Imaginaire lithographs.     Condition: Good condition. A very good impression with strong colours.

He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from his Blue and Rose period, and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque were the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental painting Guernica (1937), no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. Two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes Picasso's works were for his own lifetime established. Famous for the diversity of its expressions Pablo Picasso is one of the outstanding artists of the 20th century. (tfa)    Shipping costs excl. statutory VAT and plus 2,5% (+VAT) shipping insurance.

The dimensions, framed are 90 x 105 cm and the dimensions of the sheet are 65.4 x 50.5 cm.

The artist spent the years around the turn of the century in Paris. He established Cubism with his French friend Georges Braque, deeply influencing later avant-garde artists. His 1907 painting ‘Les Demoiselles d’Avignon’ became the key work of modernism. Picasso left behind an enormous body of work of about 50,000 artworks, comprising paintings, drawings, graphic art, sculptures and pottery. Already during Picasso’s lifetime, two museums were established in his honor: the Museo Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes in southern France.

Large panels of cardboard had been used to ship the supplies. The supplies were uncrated and the boxes and other shipping materials were set aside against a wall in Picasso's studio. Rather than seeing large pieces of cardboard, Picasso saw 29 canvases awaiting his brush, and at the age of 87 he created 29 portraits which would come to be known as the Portraits Imaginaire or Imaginairy Portraits. Each portrait was created in gouache with simple and brilliant colors. Under Picasso's personal supervision, and with the expertise of one of France's leading lithographers, Marcel Salinas, lithographs were created in the image of the 29 original Portraits Imaginaire. Proofs of the lithographs were submitted to Picasso who corrected them and noted his ""bon a tirer"" (meaning they were ""good to print""). It took a year to create the lithographs. Upon completion, the plates were destroyed. Each print is hand numbered and carries, in the plate, the signature of Picasso as it appears on the orginal gouache. Picasso did not hand sign any of the Portraits Imaginaire lithographs.Condition: Good condition. Very light discolouration of the paper due to previous matting.

Picasso: Catalogue of the Printed Graphic Work, 1904-1967. Berne: Editions Kornfeld & Klipstein, 1968. #142.   Estimate:  $3000 - $5000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were.        Coppel, Stephen.

Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)The Spanish painter, graphic artist and sculptor Pablo Picasso created a body of work of about 50,000 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and ceramics. He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. In 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from hisBlue and Rose period and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque marked the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The paintingLes Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental paintingGuernica(1937) no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. In honor of Picasso’s works, two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes, were established during his lifetime. Famous for the diversity of his expressions, Pablo Picasso is one of the outstanding artists of the 20th century.

Accompanied with certificate. Certified by Gerald Norman, member of International Art Society, Galeri d'art A prolific and tireless innovator of art forms, Pablo Picasso impacted the course of 20th-century art with unparalleled magnitude. Inspired by African and Iberian art and developments in the world around him, Picasso contributed significantly to a number of artistic movements, notably Cubism, Surrealism, Neoclassicism, and Expressionism. Along with Georges Braque, Picasso is best known for pioneering Cubism in an attempt to reconcile three-dimensional space with the two-dimensional picture plane, once asking, â€œAre we to paint whatâ€™s on the face, whatâ€™s inside the face, or whatâ€™s behind it?â€ Responding to the Spanish Civil War, he painted his most famous work, Guernica (1937), whose violent images of anguished figures rendered in grisaille made it a definitive work of anti-war art. â€œPainting is not made to decorate apartments,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s an offensive and defensive weapon against the enemy.â€ Picassoâ€™s sizable oeuvre includes over 20,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs.

Picasso: Catalogue of the Printed Graphic Work, 1904-1967. Berne: Editions Kornfeld & Klipstein, 1968. #204.   Estimate:  $3000 - $5000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were.        Coppel, Stephen.

Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)The Spanish painter, graphic artist and sculptor Pablo Picasso created a body of work of about 50,000 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and ceramics. He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. In 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from hisBlue and Rose period and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque marked the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The paintingLes Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental paintingGuernica (1937) no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. In honor of Picasso’s works, two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes, were established during his lifetime. Famous for the diversity of his expressions, Pablo Picasso is one of the outstanding artists of the 20th century.

Regarded as one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture,[3][4] the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and Guernica (1937), a portrayal of the Bombing of Guernica by the German and Italian airforces at the behest of the Spanish nationalist government during the Spanish Civil War.",Pablo Picasso - Man Head,Tue,4150,50000,55000,4150,293,United States,5,151

It was marked ""Madoura Plein Feu/Edition Picasso"" at the base.   It is partly white glazed. It was realised in the Atelier Madoura in 1952 in a limited edition of 500.  Another copy of this same plate was sold in  Chrities London on the 26th of June 2012 for £4,000.   In 1946 Picasso in Golfe Juan with his friend Louis Fort, decided to visit the pottery exhibition in Vallauris. He took a particular interest in the Madoura stand and asked to be introduced to the owners - Suzanne and Georges Ramié. They invited him to their Madoura Pottery workshop in Vallauris. There he made three pieces which he left to dry and bake.   A year later Picasso returned to see how the pieces had turned out. He was delighted with the quality of the work and asked if he could make more. They agreed and an area of the workshop was arranged especially for him. Immediately, he began to work, inspired by his portfolio of sketches. So began a long and very productive partnership between Picasso and Madoura. The whole Madoura team became part of the creative process. They made sure Picasso had all the materials he needed and assisted in producing perfectly finished works of art. Suzanne Ramié shared her vast experience, teaching him all the secrets of ceramics.  The ceramics ranged from vases, sculptures, plaques to even a complete dinner service. The familiar themes included bullfighting scenes, portraits and nature - goats, birds, and fish. In 24 years over 633 pieces were created in limited editions all engraved with the Madoura stamp.

Each consists of 250 lithographs and each piece is numbered 1-250. The ""A"" edition was reserved for America and the ""F"" edition was reserved for France.

In early 1969, art supplies arrived at Picasso's studio in Mougins on the French Riviera. Large panels of cardboard had been used to ship the supplies. The supplies were uncrated and the boxes and other shipping materials were set aside against a wall in Picasso's studio. Rather than seeing large pieces of cardboard, Picasso saw 29 canvases awaiting his brush, and at the age of 87 he created 29 portraits which would come to be known as the Portraits Imaginaire or Imaginairy Portraits. Each portrait was created in gouache with simple and brilliant colors.    Under Picasso's personal supervision, and with the expertise of one of France's leading lithographers, Marcel Salinas, lithographs were created in the image of the 29 original Portraits Imaginaire. Proofs of the lithographs were submitted to Picasso who corrected them and noted his ""bon a tirer"" (meaning they were ""good to print""). It took a year to create the lithographs. Upon completion, the plates were destroyed. Each print is hand numbered and carries, in the plate, the signature of Picasso as it appears on the orginal gouache. Picasso did not hand sign any of the Portraits Imaginaire lithographs.  ",11650: PICASSO PABLO PICASSO Color Lithograph Portrait ,Wed,4000,4500,5500,3750,3036,United Kingdom,7,338

The work is hand numbered in pencil A 134/250 at the lower left margin and dated in the plate 27.4.69 (1969) above the signature.  Two editions of the lithographs exist: The A edition and the F edition. Each consists of 250 lithographs and each piece is numbered 1-250. The A edition was reserved for America and the F edition was reserved for France. This work is from the American edition.  The paper bears the blind stamp: Lithographie executee par M.Salinas d'apres une peinture sur carton de Picasso (Lithorgraphs executes by M.Salinas after a painting on cardboard by Picasso).   In early 1969, art supplies arrived at Picasso's studio in Mougins on the French Riviera. Large panels of cardboard had been used to ship the supplies. The supplies were uncrated and the boxes and other shipping materials were set aside against a wall in Picasso's studio. Rather than seeing large pieces of cardboard, Picasso saw 29 canvases awaiting his brush, and at the age of 87 he created 29 portraits which would come to be known as the Portraits Imaginaire or Imaginairy Portraits. Each portrait was created in gouache with simple and brilliant colors.    Under Picasso's personal supervision, and with the expertise of one of France's leading lithographers, Marcel Salinas, lithographs were created in the image of the 29 original Portraits Imaginaire. Proofs of the lithographs were submitted to Picasso who corrected them and noted his bon a tirer (meaning they were good to print). It took a year to create the lithographs. Upon completion, the plates were destroyed. Each print is hand numbered and carries, in the plate, the signature of Picasso as it appears on the orginal gouache. Picasso did not hand sign any of the Portraits Imaginaire lithographs.  ",11650: PABLO PICASSO Color Lithograph Portrait Imaginai,Wed,4000,4500,5500,3750,3148,United Kingdom,7,340

Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)The Spanish painter, graphic artist and sculptor Pablo Picasso created a body of work of about 50,000 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and ceramics. He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. In 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from his Blue and Rose period and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque marked the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental painting Guernica (1937) no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. In honor of Picasso’s works, two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes, were established during his lifetime. Famous for the diversity of his expressions, Pablo Picasso is one of the outstanding artists of the 20th century.

"Terre de faïence   France, circa 1954  Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) – Spanish Cubist painter and printmaker  Oval-shaped saucière in overall hen design  Stamped on the base ‘Madoura Plein Feu’ / ‘d'Après Picasso’   From an edition of 150, this work is a variant in shape  Ramie 251  Dimensions: 5 x 3 ? x 7 in. (12.7 x 9.8 x 17.8 cm.)  Good condition  A fine example of Pablo Picasso ceramic visions conceived with Madoura Pottery after a pivotal meeting with the creators, Suzanne and Georges Ramié, in the 1946. This oval-shaped terre de faïence, or tin-glazed earthenware, saucière exhibits a rustic design with cobalt blue underglaze on a white body. The piece has been shaped to create a stylized hen form with the spout elongated outward and the handle curled inward to ingeniously simulate the head and tail of the bird, respectively. Picasso was particularly known for his spontaneous and clever play in his ceramics with animals as one of the predominant creative themes. Having produced over 3,000 pieces in editions ranging from 25 to 500, this hen is one of an edition of 150. However, although made in editions, each piece were known for being one of a kind with hand painted originality which is exemplified in the painterly aspect of the decorative brushstrokes and flecks.   Pablo Picasso (Spanish, 1881-1973) A prolific and tireless innovator of art forms, Pablo Picasso impacted the course of 20th-century art with unparalleled magnitude. Inspired by Primitivism and developments in the world around him, Picasso contributed significantly to a number of artistic movements, notably Cubism, Surrealism, Neoclassicism, and Expressionism. Along with Georges Braque, Picasso is best known for pioneering Cubism in an attempt to reconcile three-dimensional space with the two-dimensional picture plane. Picasso’s sizable oeuvre includes over 50,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs.","Pablo Picasso, Terre de Faïence, ‘Hen’, France, c. 1954",Tue,3800,4500,6300,3200,1203,United States,9,302

It is stamped at the back with the Madoura stamp ""Madoura Empreinte Originale de Picasso"".   It is numbered in black ""353/500"" at the back of the ceramic and also inscribed in black pen J.148.  The plaque is dated in the plate ""17.12.1966"" (17th of December 1966) at the upper left corner of the ceramic.   This work was conceived on 17th of December 1966 and executed in an edition of 500.   In 1946 Picasso in Golfe Juan with his friend Louis Fort, decided to visit   the pottery exhibition in Vallauris. He took a particular interest in   the Madoura stand and asked to be introduced to the owners - Suzanne and   Georges Ramié. They invited him to their Madoura Pottery workshop in   Vallauris. There he made three pieces which he left to dry and bake.   A year later Picasso returned to see how the pieces had turned out. He   was delighted with the quality of the work and asked if he could make   more. They agreed and an area of the workshop was arranged especially   for him. Immediately, he began to work, inspired by his portfolio of   sketches. So began a long and very productive partnership between   Picasso and Madoura. The whole Madoura team became part of the creative   process. They made sure Picasso had all the materials he needed and   assisted in producing perfectly finished works of art. Suzanne Ramié   shared her vast experience, teaching him all the secrets of ceramics.  The ceramics ranged from vases, sculptures, plaques to even a complete   dinner service. The familiar themes included bullfighting scenes,   portraits and nature - goats, birds, and fish. In 24 years over 633   pieces were created in limited editions all engraved with the Madoura   stamp.    Literature:   1. 1. Bloch, Georges.

"Picasso, Pablo (Spanish, 1881-1973) Etching Print. “Femme Assise ai Chapeau et Femme Debout Drapee” or ""Two Women.” Etching Print dated 1934. From the Vollard Suite, on 'Vollard' watermarked laid paper with full margins. Signed in pencil lower right Picasso and plate signed lower left Paris June 29, 1934"", from the complete edition of 250. Print is unframed and in good condition with slight toning. Measures 7 ” x 10 3/8”.   From Ledorfineart.com: The Vollard Suite was named for its publisher, the famous Parisian art dealer and critic, Ambroise Vollard. Vollard gave Picasso his first show and served as his art dealer early on. In later years, he published two of Picasso’s illustrated books, and, emboldened by the success of those projects, commissioned Picasso in 1930 to create The Vollard Suite, a group of 100 prints which became Picasso’s most celebrated series. Picasso began creating these prints in 1933 and topped the series off in 1937 with three portraits of Vollard, who narcissistically insured that every one of his stable of artists created his portrait. Picasso turned the completed copper plates over to his master printer Roger Lacourière, who printed them in 1939. Vollard met an untimely death in a car accident that same year, and the print dealer Henri Petiet purchased the edition from Vollard’s estate. Petiet acquired the entirety of the edition with the exception of the three portraits of Vollard, which may not have been delivered to Vollard at the same time as the rest, and, more accidently than otherwise, were not included in Petiet’s purchase. (The only other prints that didn’t go to Petiet were the few trial proofs, which had been retained by Lacourière and not delivered to Vollard.) Petiet convinced Picasso to start signing The Suite in the 1950s, which Picasso did sporadically for many years, probably up until 1969, when he was overwhelmed with the task of signing of The 347 Series. Although The Vollard Suite is Picasso’s most famous print series, it is important for a collector to understand that Picasso created most of his prints as individual works of art rather than as parts of any series. Furthermore, acknowledging The Vollard Suite as his most famous series does not imply that the prints it comprises are his best prints. Some of his best prints are indeed found within The Suite, but a number of other Suite prints are, frankly, not all that accomplished. Other contemporaneously created prints are just as beautiful but, because they don’t bear the cachet of being a part of The Vollard Suite, sell for a fraction of the price. And that, even though they are in general around five times rarer than The Vollard Suite prints! A discerning collector should pick and choose carefully, but at the very least should think twice before limiting his collection, or even just his collection of prints of the ‘thirties, to The Vollard Suite.Though the Suite in general was an expression of his neoclassical style, Picasso interestingly integrated a number of other styles into some of the Suite, typically with exceptional results. One of the more wonderful examples of this blend is the drypoint pictured below, Sculpteur, Modèle et Sculpture Assise, (Bloch 146, Fig. 13). The sculptor and the model are gazing upon his creation as if to ask, exactly what kind of humanoid is she? This prints seems to occasion this sort of reflection about the Frankenstein because, unlike the other sculptures in the Suite, this one seems almost as lifelike, and as life-size, as its admirers. In a way, the three figures seem engaged in a dialogue. The modestly folded arms of the creature almost seem to be saying, “What, who, me? Watcha starin’ at?” The other amusing pictorial element in this work is the model’s uncanny resemblance to Francoise Gilot, though this work precedes Picasso’s first encounter with that muse by a full decade. But it lends credence to what must be one of the best pick-up lines of all time, one which could only have been pulled off by a great portraitist such as Picasso, and which he tried on her shortly after their first meeting. He said something to the effect of (and I really need to find the exact reference), I’ve always had certain archetypes of women in my art and you’re one of them. I was painting you long before I met you. This line was on a par with his other classic one, by which he first invited Francoise to his apartment, ostensibly in order to see his etchings.   From Askart: A painter and printmaker who revolutionized western art, Pablo Picasso was born in Spain and lived most of his life either there or in France. His father was an art teacher, and the young Pablo grew up in an artistic environment. By the age of fourteen, he was an accomplished draftsman, and in 1900 at age nineteen, he made his first trip to Paris. There he studied the Old Masters and Classical sculpture and also was exposed to the paintings of Impressionists and Post Impressionists. Between 1901 and 1904, his work was dominated by a blue palette, which has led to this time being called his ""Blue Period"". Blue, for him, was to symbolize the "". . . suffering-frequently hunger and cold, the hardships he experienced while attempting to establish himself."" (Arnason, 125) By 1905, his 'Rose or Circus Period' was beginning, and also later that year, he became doing painting reflective of a growing interest in African masks. By 1907, he painted what is regarded as his first masterpiece and as the first Cubist painting, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Although he said: ""I think about Death all the time. She is the only woman who never leaves me."" (Walther) His relationships with 'live' women influenced much of his artwork. It is thought that his switch from 'blue' to 'rose', that is from depression to happiness, was determined by his meeting Fernande Olivier, allegedly his first serious female relationship. He lived with her for seven years. From that time, he did numerous portraits of wives, children and mistresses. In 1908, Picasso began working in Paris with Georges Braque (1882-1963), and together until 1914 and the beginning of World War I, they created collages* and the first phase of Cubism* that included still life and portraits. They worked so closely together that many scholars are unable to tell some of their work apart or to determine which of them contributed certain concepts. Picasso went to Rome from 1914 to 1918 to do set designs and costumes for the Russian Ballet and during this time also did some realistic painting and drawing, and printmaking emerged as a major part of his art as a result of the time he spent drawing. His graphic art, which actually dated to 1905, was diverse as he was ever looking for new modes of expression, and he did etchings, drypoint, linocuts, woodcuts, aquatints and sometimes combinations. In Rome, he met his first wife, Olga Koklova, a Russian ballet dancer. In the early part of the 1920s, he did abstract figurative work that was so grotesque in distortion that it set the stage for his participation in Surrealist* exhibitions in Europe. Also the experimentation with figurative shapes led him to sculpture, an interest he had expressed earlier. The 1920s are regarded as one of the most productive periods of Picasso's career. He did paintings with vivid coloration expressing his "". . .total experience of curvilinear cubism and classical idealism."" (Arnason, 393) In 1927, he began a relationship with seventeen-year-old Marie Therese Walther, and in 1936 with Dora Maar, a photographer. In 1937, inspired by the Spanish Civil War, he painted Guernica; this is regarded as one of his landmark paintings and certainly one that carried a strong message of human suffering during wartime. During the World War II years, Picasso did a lot of modeling in clay and creating of assemblages with found objects, and many of the pieces, especially after the War, expressed his sense of humor. Also after the War, he began creating with ceramics, and he was very productive with printmaking. His female companion, beginning 1943, was Francoise Gilot, a painter, with whom he had two children, Claude and Paloma. His last female relationship was with Jacqueline Roque, whom he met in 1953 and married in 1961. Pablo Picasso died on April 8, 1973 at the age of 91. The last eight years of his life had been difficult because of prostate problems, but he continued to be productive. Of him, it was written in Time magazine, May 26, 1980: ""To the end . . . Picasso remained Picasso; an indefatigable worker, a lover of mischief and pranks, quirky, increasingly aloof, mercurial, yet often remarkably generous and warm.""","Picasso, Pablo (1881-1973) ""Vollard"" 1934 Etching Print",Sun,3500,2000,4000,1000,855,United States,7,1460

The work is hand numbered in pencil F 125/250 at the lower left corner and dated in the plate 30.3.69 II (1969) above the signature.  Two editions of the lithographs exist: The A edition and the F edition. Each consists of 250 lithographs and each piece is numbered 1-250. The A edition was reserved for America and the F edition was reserved for France. This work is from the French edition.  The paper has a label verso glued to the paper, stating in French that this lithograph was executed by Marecel Salinas after a painting on cardboard by Picasso, in a limited edition of 250 impressions for France and a further 250 impressions for America.   In early 1969, art supplies arrived at Picasso's studio in Mougins on the French Riviera. Large panels of cardboard had been used to ship the supplies. The supplies were uncrated and the boxes and other shipping materials were set aside against a wall in Picasso's studio. Rather than seeing large pieces of cardboard, Picasso saw 29 canvases awaiting his brush, and at the age of 87 he created 29 portraits which would come to be known as the Portraits Imaginaire or Imaginairy Portraits. Each portrait was created in gouache with simple and brilliant colors.    Under Picasso's personal supervision, and with the expertise of one of France's leading lithographers, Marcel Salinas, lithographs were created in the image of the 29 original Portraits Imaginaire. Proofs of the lithographs were submitted to Picasso who corrected them and noted his bon a tirer (meaning they were good to print). It took a year to create the lithographs. Upon completion, the plates were destroyed. Each print is hand numbered and carries, in the plate, the signature of Picasso as it appears on the orginal gouache. Picasso did not hand sign any of the Portraits Imaginaire lithographs.  ",11655: PABLO PICASSO Color Lithograph Portrait Imaginai,Wed,3500,3500,5500,3000,3148,United Kingdom,7,359

Picasso: Catalogue of the Printed Graphic Work, 1904-1967. Berne: Editions Kornfeld & Klipstein, 1968. #205.   Estimate:  $3000 - $5000    MORE INFORMATION:     The most distinguished and researched set of etchings in the immense output of Pablo Picasso's career, La Suite Vollard presents a deeply personal glimpse into Picasso's life between 1930 and 1937. Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor's Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.         Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso's autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso's relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist's studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso's etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor's Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor's dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso's emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""         Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were.        Coppel, Stephen.

"Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, draughtsman, and sculptor. He is best known for co-founding the Cubist movement and for the wide variety of styles embodied in his work. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and Guernica (1937), his portrayal of the German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. Picasso demonstrated uncanny artistic talent in his early years, painting in a realistic manner through his childhood and adolescence; during the first decade of the twentieth century his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. His revolutionary artistic accomplishments brought him universal renown and immense fortunes throughout his life, making him the best-known figure in twentieth century art.

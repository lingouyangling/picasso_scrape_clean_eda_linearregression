NOTE: Standing over twenty inches tall and with a commanding physical presence, the ""Vase deux anses grand oiseau"" has an elegance and power singularly stated within the oeuvre of Picasso\'s unique ceramic works. By using darker hues and alternating the contours of the form separated by a white glaze, this large bird as a two-handled vase gains recognizable definition and movement from one compositional element to the next. Somewhat bizarrely, a smiling anthropomorphic head with incised features rests on the center of the breast, as the wings become grotesque ears and the handles ringed horns. The alternating use of color and line guides the eye from the simple-footed base to the incised features of the bird\'s head at top, always drawing us back into the plentiful middle, where we alternate between seeing both man and beast. The original signed certificate of authenticity from Maya Widmaier Picasso dated November 17, 1996 is included with this lot.

Meraud. ', <br/>, ""Ambroise Vollard was amongst Picasso's earliest dealers, beginning their relationship in 1901 and ending with Vollard's tragic death in 1939. He was influential in introducing Picasso to prominent collectors, such as Leo and Gertrude Stein, as well as works by artists he represented such as Paul Cezanne, Paul Gauguin and Henri Matisse. Though his role as Picasso's primary dealer waned after 1911, Vollard continued to promote him over the decades through his work as an "", <i>?diteur</i>, "" of editioned bronzes, prints, and art books. (1) The Vollard Suite, a series of 100 etchings commissioned by Vollard in 1927 and completed in 1937, is among Picasso's most ambitious print work in scale and subject. In the series, one of the themes examined is the artist's relationship to his muse. While allusions to his lover Marie-Th?r?se Walter figure prominently, three profile portraits of Vollard serve as an end cap to the series, presumably as a salutatory gesture. "", <br/>, 'Picasso was known to have made only a small number of portraits of Vollard in various medium, including the aforementioned etchings. His best known portrait of Vollard is also his earliest, dating to 1910, which is a paradigm example of Picasso\'s ""analytic cubist"" style. A graphite portrait on paper dated to 1915 is also known, which is a naturalistic rendering of Vollard in a formal seated pose. The present work, in its synthesis of facets and lines, strikes a balance between the fragmented depiction of 1910 and the meticulously composed portrait of 1915. It captures a moment of domestic absorption between Vollard and his cat. The frenetic lines masterfully convey the cat\'s attempts to right itself from its vulnerable, cradled position, while the heavy contours of Vollard\'s hand expresses his attempt to tame its wildness.  ', <br/>, 'The present portrait, a recently rediscovered work, may have been the inspiration for the etching with aquatint entitled ""Vollard et son Chat"" c. 1960, as well as an undated oil painting in a private collection of the same subject.

NOTE: Accompanied by a Certificate of Authenticity from the Picasso Foundation. Painted by the artist in 1918 for his dear friend, Madame Eugenia Errazuriz, this exceedingly rare fresco originally decorated a wall in her Southern France villa, La Mimoseraie. Eugenia was a patron of Modernism and was a hugely influential figure for many of the great artists of the time, including Picasso, who considered her to be his mentor, muse, and model. It was at La Mimoseraie that Picasso and his first wife, Olga Khokhlova, spent their honeymoon as guests of Eugenia. As a thank you to his hostess, Picasso shut himself away upstairs in the ""Blue Room"" and painted a series of murals depicting bathers, florals, and verses written by his dear friend, the French poet, Guillaume Apollinaire. Illustrated in this work alongside a pretty vase of flowers is the first quatrain from the poem, ""Les Saisons"", which reads: ""It was a blessed time, we passed it on the beaches Go there at first light, hatless and barefoot Quick as the flitting tongue of a toad Love\'s Cupid wounded to the heart both fool and sage alike"". For Picasso, this quatrain epitomized the mood of his classical honeymoon, with its allusion to Cupid\'s arrow and the surrounding organic imagery. The painting\'s large scale and energetic execution reflect a period of intense love and excitement for the artist. It celebrates Picasso\'s new marriage to Olga but also expresses his love of the Mediterranean, which inspired him to paint the mythological themes that became such important and enduring motifs in his art.

As early as 1947, Penn began repudiating the pictorialist modes in photography—be it fashion or portraiture—by eschewing lavish interiors and contrived narratives. Thereby, Penn permitted the clothes (in the former genre) and the individuals (in the latter) to assume the central role, prompting viewers to focus on the essence within the garment or the sitter, of which John Szarkowski has noted, ""[Penn\'s photographs] are not stories, but simply pictures."" Penn rejected the notion that portraits ought to be set within a context that readily identified the sitters—writers at their desk; singers at a hall; thespians in front of a draped velvet curtain; or artists at their studio, and layer by layer, peeled off the common traps that detracted from the point of focus. In fact, it was Penn\'s studio—not a lavish mansion, or a Louis XV boudoir, or a Victorian library—that became the sole space within which sitters were photographed.  From the late 1940\'s and throughout the 1950\'s, Penn continuously simplified his portraits, gradually removing the corners he had used in his elegant portraits of such notables as seen in Duchess of Windsor, New York, May 27,1947 (Lot 198), or the carpeted platform used in such playful portraits as seen in Max Weber, 1950, (Lot 18). By 1957, the year the present lot, Pablo Picasso at La Californie, Cannes, was taken, Penn had stripped away not only any gratuitous props but also any bodily references or gestures that could have compromised the unique individuality of the famed Spanish artist, by then already established as one of the art world\'s most luminary Ÿgures.The close-up portrait is skillfully and almost perfectly centered by Picasso\'s cyclopean eye, paying homage to the Cubist style that he was instrumental in popularizing. References to the style, in fact, abound in the photograph: the strong tonal contrasts, the cape slicing the face at an unconventional angle, the abstraction of the ear, the different lines dissecting the plain; the portrait is far more akin to Picasso\'s gris-toned Buste de Femme, 1956, than any of Penn\'s other portraits. It becomes more of a probable self-visualization by Picasso rather than a regimented projection by the photographer of how a portrait should be. Ultimately, Pablo Picasso at La Californie, Cannes, is a carefully nuanced souvenir commemorating the legacy of not one, but two great masters, both delicately revealing themselves through different sides of the same lens.']","22: IRVING PENN, Pablo Picasso at La Californie, Cannes",https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/7948261_22-irving-penn-pablo-picasso-at-la-californie-cannes,"Sold for $150,000"

This plate and etching are a part of the Carmen Suite, created by Picasso while in Paris and remembering his homeland. The collection was inspired by one of the most poignant works in Spanish literature, ""Carmen"" by Prosper Merimee, and consisted of 42 copper plates and 38 etchings, made for an illustrated version of the book, in an extremely limited edition of only 320. The plates were made by Picasso and the etchings were printed either by Picasso, or by Roger Lacourier in Paris. This piece is titled ""Picador and Bull"" and was created by Picasso in 1949.  The piece is especially significant as it is a copper plate made by Picasso for one of only four aquatints for the deluxe editions of the illustrated book ""Carmen"". Of the 320 illustrated versions of ""Carmen"", only 11 were these deluxe editions. The original etching was also created by Picasso, and was the second of four artist working proofs that were printed by the artist on wove paper, using the sugar-lift aquatint method. This is a stunning piece that truly belongs in a museum, from one of Picasso\'s greatest collections. This is a once in a lifetime chance to own an original work by arguably one of the most influential and well known artists of all time. You will never see a piece like this again, as most people would likely never see anything more than pictures of this master\'s work in art books.

These images were amazingly made by transferring a negative impression of an etching to zinc, then a needle and scraper were used to develop each progressive state. The extensive work to each state probably made the plate difficult to print from and resulted in abandoning an edition. The beautiful embossing from the deep scraping is quite apparent and gives the surface a texture not found in many lithographs. These experimental lithographs were done in January-March, 1955, in between the various fifteen paintings Picasso did of the same subject between December and April. This series of paintings and lithographs with The Women of Algiers as its theme was inspired by the paintings of Delacroix and conceived as a tribute to the recently deceased Matisse, Picasso’s artistic colleague. When questioned about this series, Picasso remarked to Roland Penrose, “When Matisse died he left his odalisques to me as a legacy and this is my idea of the Orient though I have never been there.” During a morning we spent with Les femmes d’Alger [painting(s)], Picasso showed us a schoolboy’s exercise-book that had belonged to Delacroix. He kept it lying open in the little engraving-room where the press was… Picasso handled the exercise-book with love. He showed us the writing, and in particular the little drawings in the margins of Delacroix’s schoolboy exercises. Hélène Parmelin, Picasso Plain, New York, 1963, p. 78 …Picasso’s intent oscillates between the professional and the erotic. Conventional sex symbols, forthright as a schoolboy’s graffiti, become the material of sophisticated corrdination. The artists moves from the evocation of female forms blown by desire, to the overall order within which all forms, anatomic and otherwise, serve to articulate surface tension; from the projections of women heaped and proffered like fruit, to stretching the field clear and taut for the charting of information.

Picasso variiert in der grafischen Suite unterschiedliche Themen wie Künstler und Modell oder den Minotaurus-Mythos. Das eindrucksvolle Hauptblatt der Suite wurde von Picasso am 12. Juni 1936 fertiggestellt und ist sowohl kompositorisch als auch technisch ein Meisterwerk. Es besticht durch seine kontrastreichen und dennoch äußerst harmonischen Nuancen. Die helle Binnenzeichnung in der Aquatinta vor der dunklen Wand des Hintergrundes erzeugt einen reizvollen, warmen Lichteffekt. Das Motiv basiert auf der Verführung Antiopes durch den Gottvater Zeus aus der griechischen Mytologie, später in der römischen Mythologie durch Jupiter ersetzt.

In 1949, Picasso designed and lithographed his first dove for the Paris World Peace Congress. In 1955, the work was awarded with the World Peace Prize. Since then, the dove is considered a worldwide symbol for peace, inspiring numerous artists, graphic artists and songwriters. The present drawing by Picasso fit thematically with the traditional running of the Cross de l'Humanité, which was held in Paris in 1963.

He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. In 1901, Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from his Blue and Rose period, and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque were the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental painting Guernica (1937), no other work has marked the art of the 20th century in the same way. Two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes, were opened in his honor during his lifetime. Famous for the diversity of its expressions, Pablo Picasso is one of the most outstanding artists of the 20th century.</p>, <br/>, ' ', <p><i>Shipping costs excl. statutory VAT and plus 2,5% (+VAT) shipping insurance.</i></p>, ' ', <p><i>Due to the legal obligation for the resale royalty in the art market the following applies: As a result of its membership in the AV Kunst, Auctionata charges additionally to the hammer price the contribution to the AV Kunst of currently 2.1% of the revenues from the sale of fine arts and photographs pro rata towards the buyer.

The ensemble of black and white images is an essay in the continuity of the medium’s tradition. It pays homage to the print-making heritage of Rembrandt, (to the point of directly representing the Dutchman himself in a number of plates), as well as acknowledging his compatriota, Goya, whose influential Taurmaquias are echoed in the climatic funereal sequence of the bullfighting scenes which close the Suite. The group of images confirms that Picasso, more than any of his contemporaries, was a product of his time, looking to reinvent and redevelop his visual vocabulary. The lucidity in his crisp and crinkled lines is the work of a mature artist and his distinctive qualities cannot be imagined without the cubist distortions he himself introduced two decades earlier. However, as Robert Hughes has noted, it was not just formal mastery that distinguished his singular work. In the eyes of the late critic, Picasso’s place in twentieth century consciousness was aided by his ‘unrivalled capacity for generating metaphors and images of metamorphoses.’<a href=""#_ftn1"">[1]</a>Nowhere are these two features of the essential Picasso, employed more emphatically than in the Vollard Suite.</p>, <br/>, <p><br/>The collection of one hundred images was commissioned by, and later named after, Ambroise Vollard – the Parisian art dealer who, back in 1901, had given el español his first exhibition in France. The majority of the intaglios were executed in the early 1930s following Picasso’s purchase of a new château-studio in Boisgelup, a small village sixty-three kilometres outside of Paris. In the tranquillity of this hamlet, Picasso would spend long days with his young muse, lover, and later mother of his first child, Marie-Thérèse Walter. And it is they, Marie and Pablo, who are the protagonists of the passions and struggles in the Vollard Suite. Their identities, however, are woven in the oeuvre’s two major themes stemming from Picasso’s interest in Classical literature: the Minotaur (the half-man half-bull creature) and Pygmalion (the artist who fell in love with his model), both characters taken from Ovid’s Metamorphoses.</p>, <br/>, <p><br/>In developing the series, Picasso introduced the Minotaur in May 1933 as a replacement for Pygmalion the sculptor – the artist’s original alter-ego. This new personage, the mythical man-beast, served as a fitting symbol of the artist’s own legendary artistic vitality and sexual energy. Marie-Thérèse continues to feature throughout the suite as an object of Picasso’s desires: though she goes from being a sensual ivory goddess, adored by the sculptor who brought her into existence and morphs into the sexually charged lover of the hairy, yet dignified, man-bull. In Minotaure Caressant une Dormeuse, the beautiful, nude Marie is at her most vulnerable. In deep, satisfying sleep, she is hardly perturbed by the dominant presence of the towering Minotaur who is, by contrast, fixed on her; this indifference only accentuates the hybrid beast’s gentleness and tender caress of the woman’s hand.</p>, <br/>, <p><br/>Going beyond the imagery, Picasso the peintre-graveur, demonstrates his technical proficiency in the handling of the intaglio. Departing from the clean and graceful lines that distinguished the images of Pygmalion and his muse, the present work, is made up of various techniques of mark-making: from the nervous, yet crisp outline of the male and female figures, to the curly and wiry squiggles of hair covering the Minotaur’s head and chest; from the light and soft linear shading between the two lovers, to the compact crosshatched blanket in the darkened background. In moving effortlessly between various styles and techniques – a Picassoan trait par excellence – we are reminded of the genius of the Spanish master.</p>, <br/>, <p><br/>Although Picasso continued to produce graphic prints till the very end of his career, he would never quite recapture the intensity or creative genius that characterises this impassioned series. A key image in Picasso’s oeuvre, Minotaure Caressant une Dormeuse remains one of the most prized and collected of all graphic works by that quasi-mythical figure in twentieth century art.</p>, <br/>, <p><br/>Petrit Abazi</p>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <p><br/><a href=""#_ftnref1"">[1]</a>Robert Hughes, ‘Picasso’, in The Fifth Sir William Dobell Memorial Lecture, The Sir William Dobell Art Foundation, Sydney, 1981, p.5.</p>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <p><br/> </p>]","PABLO PICASSO (SPANISH, 1881-1973) Minotaure Caressant",https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/44861459_pablo-picasso-spanish-1881-1973-minotaure-caressant,"Sold for A$62,000"

Picasso's almost 200 linocuts are whimsical, energized, and gestural, covering a variety of themes, such as bullfights, still lifes, the artist and his model, dancers and musicians, nudes, lovers, portraits, and interpretations of Old Master paintings.  Beginning in 1951, he also employed linocut for a series of posters for the annual pottery exhibition in Vallauris.  Apart from these posters, the linocuts were published by Galerie Louise Leiris in Paris, under the supervision of Picasso's longtime dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler.</p>, <p>In 1963, toward the end of his career, Picasso invented a new technique for his linocuts, the rinsing method, in order to create a handmade appearance:</p>, <p><i>He first prints the linoleum block [on white paper] in a cream white ink that repels water.  He then rinses the print in a water based India ink, which is absorbed by the non-printed areas of the sheet.  He then washes the ink from the sheet, thus removing it from the areas that had been printed in the cream white ink</i> (A. Hyman, <i>The Complete Linoleum Cuts, 1939-1968</i> in <i>Picasso's Paintings, Watercolors, Drawings and Sculpture: A Comprehensive Illustrated Catalogue 1885-1973</i>, San Francisco, 2012, preface).</p>, <p>Exemplifying the rinsed linocut, the 1964 <i>Journal</i> <i>au profil</i>, also known as <i>Collage with Stick Figures</i>, is unique for several reasons.  As a depiction of a page of advertisements from the Nice newspaper <i>Patriote</i>, it is Picasso's only linocut that plays with the theme of a journal.  As such, it references his early synthetic Cubist collages coupling newspaper print with everyday objects. In addition, <i>Journal au profil</i> features mixed media and is therefore a variation of the traditional linocut.  For the base print, Picasso used a letterpress engraving with inset linocut images of bulls and figures that he had made the previous year, <i>Profil, corrida, faune, et centaure poursuivant une baigneuse</i>.  For the final product, he painted the bowl and pipe on top of this newspaper engraving, rinsed the sheet with India ink, and selectively washed off the ink to reveal underlying passages of white.  The resulting effect is layered and complex, simultaneously evoking painting, printmaking and collage.<br/><br/><b>Alternate Artist Spellings:</b> ""Pablo Picasso"", ""Picasso, Pablo"", ""Picasso, Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Crispín Crispiniano de la Santissima Trinidad Ruiz Blasco"", ""Picasso, Pablo Ruiz"", ""Picasso, Pablo Ruiz y"", ""Ruiz Picasso, Pablo"", ""Ruiz y Picasso, Pablo"", ""Ruiz, Pablo"", ""Ruys Picasso, Pablo"", ""Ruys, Pablo""

Bonne fË†te / Jacqueline / 6.II.61'. ('By reading the newspapers we become wise... we know that for example, today is St. Dorothy's day / So, Happy St. Dorothy's day / Jacqueline / 6.II.61').  Presumably Picasso executed this sketch of a bouquet with three flowers in loose yet characteristically confident manner, in response to this note from Jacqueline. The flowers sketched refer to the legend of St. Dorothy: On her way to execution, due to her refusal of renouncing Christian faith, the young girl was mockingly requested by a doubting lawyer, Theophilus, to send him fruit from the heaven. St. Dorothy received a basket of three apples and three roses from an angel when she kneeled for prayer, which she gifted to the unbelieving lawyer. The young lawyer then converted to Christianity.  St. Dorothy is known as the patron saint of florists and brides, and February 6th is St. Dorothy's day that Jacqueline wrote the note and Picasso responded by this sketch.

French painter Jean Crotti invented the technique in the 1930s and perfected the process over the next twenty years through the assistance of his neighbor and business associates- the Malherbe-Navarre family (father and two sons), who were physicists that specialized in the molecular diffusion of light and fluorescence. In the early 1950s, they patented the idea and opened a production studio, ""Les Gemmaux de France."" Whereas stained glass proper uses lead ', <b>came</b>, ' to join the pieces of glass, creating metal divisions (tracery)between them, gemmail is a more holistic process whereby multiple fragments of glass in varying sizes, shapes and colors are layered on a large piece of clear glass and then immersed in a special enamel solution to set the composition. The work is then placed in a low fire kiln that allows the pieces to bond, but not melt, creating a translucent painting that retains the clarity and superposition of the fragments.', <br/>, <br/>, 'Pablo Piccasso was immediately enamored by gemmail when fellow artist Jean Cocteau introduced him to it in 1954, and began experimenting with the process and collaboratively working with Crotti and the Malherbe-Navarres.

Gemmail pieces are typically signed before they are fired, so if ""Le Repas des Enfants"" was not produced by the Malherbe-Navarres on behalf of Picasso, then by whom?

In 1936 Dora Maar was with Picasso in Mouguins accompanied also by Man Ray and Paul Eluard. They met charming Italian sisters who were working in the Hotel Vaste Horizon. The two were employed by Picasso as cook and chamber maid. Little by little these two girls began to take a prominent part in the life of the painter. Ines married in 1942 with Gustave Sassier and lived , together with their son Gerard, born in 1946, in a small apartment close to the painter at 7 rue des Grandes Augustines in Paris. Ines became a constant companion and friend of the artist. When Picasso moved to the South of France in 1955 Innes looked after the property owned by the artist in Paris and would come down to the south during the school holidays. When the painter sold his Paris apartment in 1967 Innes made the necessary arrangements for the move on Picasso\'s behalf. Her son, Gerard, says today that the huge house was ""un musee incroyable"" with such a huge quantity of works by Picasso. Innes moved to Mougins where she took the job as chauffeur until 1970 when she left the artists service. It can be seen that the relationship lasted from 1937 until 1970. Sometimes Innes served as a model and was no doubt privy to all the affairs of Picasso during this period with Dora Maar, Francoise Gillot, Marie-Therese Waller and Jacqueline Picasso. Picasso had two great confidants in his life during this turbulent period: Innes Sassier and Jaume Sabartes. During the time of her acquaintanceship with Picasso Innes was given a number of works consisting of graphics, livres illustrees, autographs, letters and, especially, drawings made by the artist for her son Gerard Sassier. For the most part these consisted of decoupages (or paper cut-outs) showing childish scenes such as circuses, cars and animals.

Impressed by the quality of the resulting works, the artist decided to produce more ceramics in collaboration with Madoura. Inspired by ancient terracotta ‘tanagra’ figurines, Picasso had the idea to create a series of standing, kneeling and seated female figures in 1947. Picasso experimented with ceramic and perfected his pottery skills for over 20 years.

He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from his Blue and Rose period, and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque were the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental painting Guernica (1937), no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. Two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes Picasso's works were for his own lifetime established.

In 1936 Dora Maar was with Picasso in Mouguins accompanied also by Man Ray and Paul Eluard. They met charming Italian sisters who were working in the Hotel Vaste Horizon. The two were employed by Picasso as cook and chamber maid. Little by little these two girls began to take a prominent part in the life of the painter. Ines married in 1942 with Gustave Sassier and lived , together with their son Gerard, born in 1946, in a small apartment close to the painter at 7 rue des Grandes Augustines in Paris. Ines became a constant companion and friend of the artist. When Picasso moved to the South of France in 1955 Innes looked after the property owned by the artist in Paris and would come down to the south during the school holidays. When the painter sold his Paris apartment in 1967 Innes made the necessary arrangements for the move on Picasso\'s behalf. Her son, Gerard, says today that the huge house was ""un musee incroyable"" with such a huge quantity of works by Picasso. Innes moved to Mougins where she took the job as chauffeur until 1970 when she left the artists service. It can be seen that the relationship lasted from 1937 until 1970. Sometimes Innes served as a model and was no doubt privy to all the affairs of Picasso during this period with Dora Maar, Francoise Gillot, Marie-Therese Waller and Jacqueline Picasso. Picasso had two great confidants in his life during this turbulent period : Innes Sassier and Jaume Sabartes. During the time of her acquaintanceship with Picasso Innes was given a number of works consisting of graphics, livres illustrees, autographs, letters and, especially, drawings made by the artist for her son Gerard Sassier. For the most part these consisted of decoupages (or paper cut-outs) showing childish scenes such as circuses, cars and animals.

The works from his Blue and Rose period, and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque were the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental painting Guernica (1937), no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. Two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes Picasso's works were for his own lifetime established.

In 1936 Dora Maar was with Picasso in Mouguins accompanied also by Man Ray and Paul Eluard. They met charming Italian sisters who were working in the Hotel Vaste Horizon. The two were employed by Picasso as cook and chamber maid. Little by little these two girls began to take a prominent part in the life of the painter. Innes married in 1942 with Gustave Sassier and lived, together with their son Gerard, born in 1946, in a small apartment close to the painter at 7 rue des Grandes Augustines in Paris. Innes became a constant companion and friend of the artist. When Picasso moved to the South of France in 1955 Innes looked after the property owned by the artist in Paris and would come down to the south during the school holidays. When the painter sold his Paris apartment in 1967 Innes made the necessary arrangements for the move on Picasso\'s behalf. Her son, Gerard, says today that the huge house was ""un musee incroyable"" with such a huge quantity of works by Picasso. Innes moved to Mougins where she took the job as chauffeur until 1970 when she left the artist\'s service. It can be seen that the relationship lasted from 1937 until 1970. Sometimes Innes served as a model and was no doubt privy to all the affairs of Picasso during this period with Dora Maar, Francoise Gillot, Marie-Therese Waller and Jacqueline Picasso. Picasso had two great confidants in his life during this turbulent period: Innes Sassier and Jaume Sabartes. During the time of her acquaintanceship with Picasso Innes was given a number of works consisting of graphics, livres illustrees, autographs, letters and, especially, drawings made by the artist for her son Gerard Sassier. For the most part these consisted of decoupages (or paper cut-outs) showing childish scenes such as circuses, cars and animals.  Accompanied by a certificate of authenticity from Maya Picasso, the artist\'s daughter.']","249: Pablo Picasso, Spanish Art",https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/7609442_249-pablo-picasso-spanish-art,"Sold for $21,999"

In vielen der Blätter ist ein Bildhauer mit bärtigem Zeuskopf die Hauptfigur[...]. Als Leitmotiv durchzieht die Parallele von sexueller und schöpferischer Potenz die gesamte Suite Vollard. Die Omnipotenz des Künstlers drückt sich dabei häufig auch in der Allgegenwart und Kraft seines Blickes aus. Selbst die Anwesenheit des Bildhauers in seinem überdimensionalen Portraitkopf zeigt noch die Möglichkeit zu verändern und zu verwandeln. Quatre femmes nues et tête sculptée vom 10. März 1934 ist eines der letzten Blätter aus der Suite Vollard''. Die Veränderung der Szene, die von Haremsdarstellungen wie Jean-Dominique Ingres' Le bain turc oder Eugène Delacroix' Femmes d'Alger inspiriert ist, kann anhand der vier erhaltenen Zustände genau verfolgt werden.

The two were employed by Picasso as cook and chamber maid. Little by little these two girls began to take a prominent part in the life of the painter. Ines married in 1942 with Gustave Sassier and lived , together with their son Gerard, born in 1946, in a small apartment close to the painter at 7 rue des Grandes Augustines in Paris. Ines became a constant companion and friend of the artist. When Picasso moved to the South of France in 1955 Innes looked after the property owned by the artist in Paris and would come down to the south during the school holidays. When the painter sold his Paris apartment in 1967 Innes made the necessary arrangements for the move on Picasso\'s behalf. Her son, Gerard, says today that the huge house was ""un musee incroyable"" with such a huge quantity of works by Picasso. Innes moved to Mougins where she took the job as chauffeur until 1970 when she left the artists service. It can be seen that the relationship lasted from 1937 until 1970. Sometimes Innes served as a model and was no doubt privy to all the affairs of Picasso during this period with Dora Maar, Francoise Gillot, Marie-Therese Waller and Jacqueline Picasso. Picasso had two great confidants in his life during this turbulent period: Innes Sassier and Jaume Sabartes. During the time of her acquaintanceship with Picasso Innes was given a number of works consisting of graphics, livres illustrees, autographs, letters and, especially, drawings made by the artist for her son Gerard Sassier. For the most part these consisted of decoupages (or paper cut-outs) showing childish scenes such as circuses, cars and animals.

Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor\'s Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.', <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, 'Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso\'s autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso\'s relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist\'s studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso\'s etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor\'s Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor\'s dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso\'s emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""', <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, ""Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were."", <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, 'Coppel, Stephen.

Note: A group of Italian glass artists (mostly Venetian) formed an association in Murano called the Centro Studio Pittori in the early 1950s. The organization of talented artists worked to render exquisite works of art glass with the assistance of leading art furnaces and the iconic American art patron, Peggy Guggenheim. The Centro Sudio Pittori reached out to noted painters at the time to collaborate with their art to create modern masterworks in glass. In 1954, the association altered their name to Fucina Degli Angeli (Furnace of Angels) and were working with artists such as Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder, Jean Arp, Marc Chagall, and Henry Moore. The artists provided drawings and other projects that the skilled association would render for them in glass by master glass blowers such as Ermanno Nason, Aldo Bon, Albino Carrara, Archimede Seguso and others. The designs after Picasso\'s drawings were originally conceived in 1947 and originally intended to be rendered in ceramic, later on in the early to mid 1950s, his design was realized in glass.

As one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and Guernica (1937), a portrayal of the Bombing of Guernica by the German and Italian airforces at the behest of the Spanish nationalist government during the Spanish Civil War.    Picasso, Henri Matisse and Marcel Duchamp are regarded as the three artists who most defined the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts in the opening decades of the 20th century, responsible for significant developments in painting, sculpture, printmaking and ceramics.    Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a realistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. His work is often categorised into periods. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906), the African-influenced Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919).  Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.""]",PABLO PICASSO (Spanish1881-1973),https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/31247065_pablo-picasso-spanish1881-1973,"Sold for $15,000"

Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor\'s Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.', <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, 'Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso\'s autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso\'s relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist\'s studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso\'s etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor\'s Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor\'s dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso\'s emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""', <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, ""Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were."", <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, 'Coppel, Stephen.

We were young and drawn to it by our love of Picasso’s work and the charm and beauty of the south of France. The initial sight of that ancient building with its stone walls and floors; the thick wooden tables covered with pottery, moved us in some profound way. The Madoura ceramics - based both in antiquity and in the designs of Suzanne Ramié were unlike any others we had seen. They had an earthy elegance. And throughout the rooms were the Picasso ceramics - pieces on walls and on tables - plaques, vases, plates and jugs. As we marveled at the pieces we listened to stories told to us by Jeanine and Monique - the two women who had been working there since the time of Picasso. On our first trip we bought a plate and a small tile that was a gift. It was the first of many trips to Vallauris and Madoura. We became familiar with the history, and got to meet and speak with Alain Ramié who shared with us some of his collection of Picasso prints as well as the Picasso pieces that they kept there. Sometimes one of them would surprise us by going into the backroom and bringing forth some special piece that we hadn’t seen before. In all it was a magical wonderful place where the past connected to the present through everything we saw or experienced around us. In the years since we have still retained our love for the ceramics and Madoura. We studied the variations in method and process. We chose pieces that we felt were very strong examples. Our collection was filled with the joie de vivre spirit which permeated Picasso’s Post-War work. We have always been particularly interested in variations, especially as seen in pieces such as Four Enlaced Profiles or the Flute Players or Goat Head in Profile. We hope that those starting out a collection today will feel some of this magical fascination and love for the Picasso ceramics as we have.']","1: PABLO PICASSO, Brown/Blue Face, 1947",https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/11366104_1-pablo-picasso-brownblue-face-1947,"Sold for $14,000"

In 1930, Vollard, encouraged by the success of two earlier ventures, ambitiously commissioned 100 plates from Picasso and by 1937 the plates were completed n his Neo-classical style and given to master printer Roger Lacouriere to print. The entire edition comprises 3 copies on parchment, 50 copies on larger format Montval paper (50 x 38 cm) and 250 on smaller format Montval paper 44.5 x 34.0).

Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor\'s Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.', <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, 'Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso\'s autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso\'s relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist\'s studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso\'s etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor\'s Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor\'s dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso\'s emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""', <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, ""Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were."", <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, 'Coppel, Stephen.

The present ceramic plate, created in collaboration with Madoura in Vallauris, shows a goat, one of Picasso's favorite animals. At this time he even had a goat called Esmeralda as a pet, which he often depicted on plates and jugs. The technique of ‘empreinte originale’, which creates raised lines through carving into the mold and pressing soft clay onto it, allows to render the structure of the rough fur. This plate is from an edition of 250 that were manufactured in June 1952. The beige-colored head with accents in black, blue and light green is rendered on a grayish blue ground. The irregularity of the decoration is probably due to the fact that the ceramics were fired in a wood-fired kiln until 1953, creating beautiful pieces of great expressiveness. Today Picasso’s Madoura ceramics are highly sought after by collectors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ceramic plate is in flawless condition.

He first attended the Art Academy La Llotja in Barcelona and from 1897 onwards the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid, which he quit without graduating. The artist spent the years around the turn of the century in Paris. He established Cubism with his French friend Georges Braque, deeply influencing later avant-garde artists. His painting of 1907 ‘Les Demoiselles d’Avignon’ became the key work of modernism. Picasso left behind an enormous body of work of around 50.000 works of art, comprising paintings, drawings, graphic art, sculptures and pottery. Already during Picasso’s lifetime, two museums were established in his honor: the Museo Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes in Southern France.</p>, <br/>, ' ', <p><i>Shipping costs excl. statutory VAT and plus 2,5% (+VAT) shipping insurance.</i></p>, ' ', <p><i>Due to the legal obligation for the resale royalty in the art market the following applies: As a result of its membership in the AV Kunst, Auctionata charges additionally to the hammer price the contribution to the AV Kunst of currently 2.1% of the revenues from the sale of fine arts and photographs pro rata towards the buyer.

He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from his Blue and Rose period, and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque were the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental painting Guernica (1937), no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. Two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes Picasso's works were for his own lifetime established.

In 1930, Vollard, encouraged by the success of two earlier ventures, ambitiously commissioned 100 plates from Picasso and by 1937 the plates were completed n his Neo-classical style and given to master printer Roger Lacouriere to print. The entire edition comprises 3 copies on parchment, 50 copies on larger format Montval paper (50 x 38 cm) and 250 on smaller format Montval paper 44.5 x 34.0).

Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor\'s Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.', <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, 'Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso\'s autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso\'s relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist\'s studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso\'s etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor\'s Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor\'s dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso\'s emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""', <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, ""Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were."", <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, 'Coppel, Stephen.

Amounting to 100 etchings in total, the suite was produced at a critical juncture in his life, both emotionally and artistically. Picasso was rekindling his interest in sculpture while inciting a passionate affair with his young lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, resulting in a tension between ""the rival claims of making art and making love."" While there is no strict order to the suite, the art historian Hans Bollinger categorized the plates into five main themes – Battle of Love, the Sculptor\'s Studio, Rembrandt, the Minotaur, and the Blind Minotaur – in addition to 27 miscellaneous plates and three portraits of Vollard. The group of 100 started with eleven that Picasso, or most likely Vollard, had chosen from those made between 1930 and 1932. Picasso then produced about 40 plates in six weeks, and by 1936, he had produced 97. In 1937, Vollard convinced him to create an even 100 with three portrait etchings of Vollard himself.', <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, 'Picasso was a self-taught printmaker, but in his career he produced over 2,500 prints. La Suite Vollard shifts ""from one state to another, from contemplative repose in the studio to brutal, animalistic violence, matched by changes in style from lucid crispness of line to aggressively worked plates."" The inclusion of this emotional turmoil, like most of his works, is characteristic of Picasso\'s autobiographical style: ""The paintings, finished or not, are the pages of my journal, and as such they are valid."" Each work is meticulously dated with the year, month, and day. At this period in his life, Picasso\'s relationship with his wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, was disintegrating. He was exasperated by their differences in lifestyle and by 1925, the apartment was divided into separate living quarters – the downstairs pristine and bourgeois, the upstairs a frenzied artist\'s studio. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, a beautiful young girl with an athletic build and Grecian profile, the perfect muse for Picasso\'s etchings and sculptures. The Sculptor\'s Studio group of etchings features Picasso the sculptor contemplating his work as well as his model, the sculptor\'s dilemma in attempting to create a perfect version of reality (Le Repos du Sculpteur et la Sculpture Surréaliste). Picasso weaves mythology throughout the suite, reimagining the events of his life as a fantastical drama. Marie-Thérèse figures prominently as a sort of Venus, a classical beauty posing for Picasso the sculptor, the scene teetering on the verge of passionate submission. The scene often becomes violent, as in Le Viol and Le Viol II, expressions of emotional and ultimately physical obsession with the subject. He later becomes the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, ""whose power, pride and ferocity he regarded as corresponding to his own personality."" In Minotaure attaquant une Amazone, the beast is possessed by ""sexual frenzy and unbridled passion,"" yet in the etching Minotaure mourant, the Minotaur dying in an arena reaches out to Marie-Thérèse for aid, forgiveness, pity. The 16 etchings offered here represent each theme of the suite as well as every stage of Picasso\'s emotional life, ""the bullfight to the end.""', <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, ""Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939) was originally from a small French colony in the Indian Ocean called La Réunion. Trained as a lawyer, he opened a small gallery in 1893 where he championed the French painters Edouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne with solo shows. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Vollard's business sense earned him considerable wealth. In addition to dealing in the most avant-garde artworks of the era, Vollard published numerous books with poetry and illustrations, working with artists such as Auguste Rodin, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, and Georges Rouault. The relationship between Vollard and Picasso began in June 1901 when Vollard gave the young painter an exhibition in his gallery. In 1910, Vollard purchased the originals of five of Picasso's sculptures, and throughout the 1920s, the two worked together to publish Picasso's etchings that would precede in subject matter La Suite Vollard. Having died in a car accident as the suite was being completed in 1939, Vollard was unable to effectively market the works and the entire inventory was soon sold to Baron Henri Petiet, another Parisian dealer who would disseminate sets and single impressions for the next several decades. Picasso was known to sign the edition only sporadically from the 1950s through the late 1960s, and many examples show up today with little provenance and spurious signatures. The following 16 lots were purchased directly from Petiet by the Hatfield Gallery on September 19, 1973 and are unsigned, as many impressions from the suite were."", <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, <br/>, 'Coppel, Stephen.

However, the simplicity of inking is intentional, linocut ink is a thick oily substance and repels water, Picasso discovered that if he printed in white ink and then over worked the printed area in a black water-based ink he could create an almost negative image. The process was simple, Picasso took the printed sheets and rinsed them in the shower, hence the term rincée, washing the black ink from the oil-based white ink leaving only the merest traces of the black in the unprinted areas.

VG   £8000-12000    €10000 - 15000Portrait de Jacqueline (“Jacqueline´s Portrait”) is a lithograph by Picasso, done in Cannes, on 4th December 1956. Portrait de Jacqueline was initially intended as a poster for the Picasso exhibition “Un demi siècle de livres illustrés” (“Half a century of picture books”) at the Matarasso Gallery in Nice, 21st December 1956 to 31st January 1957. At the last moment, Picasso started over and executed a second magnificent three colour portrait of Jacqueline. Picasso worked right side out in lithographic crayon on three zincs which Matarasso brought to him. The run was executed on an offset press in Marseille, which explains why the image and the date are right reading, whereas in a non-offset lithograph run the printing would be reversed. A few proofs were done for the artist and printer in various colours. A hundred impressions of the lithograph Portrait de Jacqueline numbered and signed by Picasso were issued. Jacqueline Roque (1927-1986) Second wife of Picasso 1961-73 until the artist´s death. Jacqueline Picasso killed herself by gunshot in 1986 when she was 59 years old. A muse and source of inspiration of Picasso who created over 400 portraits of her. Pablo Picasso met Jacqueline in Vallauris, French Riviera, in 1953, she was 26 years old and he was 72. He romanced her by drawing a dove on her house in chalk and bringing her one rose a day until she agreed to date him six months later. They married in 1961.It is likely that Picasso's series of paintings derived from Delacroix´s The Women of Algiers was inspired by Roque. The artist commented that `Delacroix had already met Jacqueline´.After Picasso's death in 1973, Françoise Gilot, Pablo´s companion 1943-53, and mother of his two children, contested the will in favour of Roque on the grounds that Picasso was mentally ill. Provenance, the present document was offered by Picasso to his friend Manfredo Borsi in 1957 during a visit of the last to Picasso in Vallauris, and has been kept since by Borsi´s wife family Bianca Valentini Borsi, belonging today to her sister by inheritance. Manfredo Borsi (1900-1967) Italian Painter, Ceramicist and Lithographer. Borsi was graduated in the Florence academy of Arts, specialized in enamel ceramics. Borsi met Picasso in the 20´s in Paris and both became friends. Both moved to the south of France, Picasso to Vallauris, while Borsi moved to St Paul de Vence.Accompanied by a certificate issued and signed by Claude Picasso confirming that the lithograph is authentically signed and inscribed by Picasso.

He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. In 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from hisBlue and Rose period and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque marked the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The paintingLes Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental paintingGuernica(1937) no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. In honor of Picasso’s works, two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes, were established during his lifetime. Famous for the diversity of his expressions, Pablo Picasso is one of the outstanding artists of the 20th century.

He studied at the Royal Academy in Madrid and at the Art Academy in Barcelona, where his father taught. In 1901 Picasso had his first exhibition in a gallery in Paris, followed by numerous international exhibitions. The works from hisBlue and Rose period and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque marked the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The paintingLes Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental paintingGuernica(1937) no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. In honor of Picasso’s works, two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes, were established during his lifetime.

An extremely rare three colour proof for artist or printer of Portrait de Jacqueline (''JacquelineÂ´s Portrait'') by Picasso, 12th April 1956, signed and inscribed by Picasso to the bottom left corner to his friend and artist Manfredo Borsi `Pour mon cher Borsi, son ami, PicassoÂ´ (''to my dear Borsi, his friend, Picasso''). The present copy being almost certainly one of the proofs for artist or printer done in 1956, offered to his colleague, and therefore do not bear the number of the one hundred numbered lithographs signed by the artist. The three colour drawing being black, blue and brown. The signature and inscription being in red pencil, the first underlined in red and blue pencil. The present document size being in full 19.8 x 26,1, (50,2cm x 66,4cm), while the drawing portrait and date sizes are 15.3 x 20.4, (39cm x 52cm). VG   Â£5000-8000       Portrait de Jacqueline (''JacquelineÂ´s Portrait'') is a lithograph by Picasso, done in Cannes, on 4th December 1956. Portrait de Jacqueline was initially intended as a poster for the Picasso exhibition ''Un demi siÃ¨cle de livres illustrÃ©s'' (''Half a century of picture books'') at the Matarasso Gallery in Nice, 21st December 1956 to 31st January 1957. At the last moment, Picasso started over and executed a second magnificent three colour portrait of Jacqueline. Picasso worked right side out in lithographic crayon on three zincs which Matarasso brought to him. The run was executed on an offset press in Marseille, which explains why the image and the date are right reading, whereas in a non-offset lithograph run the printing would be reversed. A few proofs were done for the artist and printer in various colours.  A hundred impressions of the lithograph Portrait de Jacqueline numbered and signed by Picasso were issued.  Jacqueline Roque (1927-1986) Second wife of Picasso 1961-73 until the artistÂ´s death. Jacqueline Picasso killed herself by gunshot in 1986 when she was 59 years old. A muse and source of inspiration of Picasso who created over 400 portraits of her. Pablo Picasso met Jacqueline in Vallauris, French Riviera, in 1953, she was 26 years old and he was 72. He romanced her by drawing a dove on her house in chalk and bringing her one rose a day until she agreed to date him six months later. They married in 1961.  It is likely that Picasso's series of paintings derived from DelacroixÂ´s The Women of Algiers was inspired by Roque. The artist commented that `Delacroix had already met JacquelineÂ´.  After Picasso's death in 1973, FranÃ§oise Gilot, PabloÂ´s companion 1943-53, and mother of his two children, contested the will in favour of Roque on the grounds that Picasso was mentally ill.  Provenance, the present document was offered by Picasso to his friend Manfredo Borsi in 1957 during a visit of the last to Picasso in Vallauris, and has been kept since by BorsiÂ´s wife family Bianca Valentini Borsi, belonging today to her sister by inheritance.  Manfredo Borsi (1900-1967) Italian Painter, Ceramicist and Lithographer. Borsi was graduated in the Florence academy of Arts, specialized in enamel ceramics. Borsi met Picasso in the 20Â´s in Paris and both became friends. Both moved to the south of France, Picasso to Vallauris, while Borsi moved to St Paul de Vence.  Accompanied by a certificate issued and signed by Claude Picasso confirming that the lithograph is authentically signed and inscribed by Picasso.

The works from his Blue and Rose period, and the establishing of cubism along with Georges Braque were the beginning of his extraordinary artistic career. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) is one of the best known works of Picasso. Like his monumental painting Guernica (1937), no other work has marked the art of the 20th century. Two museums, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and the Musée Picasso in Antibes Picasso's works were for his own lifetime established. Famous for the diversity of its expressions Pablo Picasso is one of the outstanding artists of the 20th century.
